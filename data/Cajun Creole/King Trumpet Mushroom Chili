This is a tasty chilli recipe but the mushrooms didn't jump out at me at all. I might try it with a more potent fungi next time. Also, the cornbread recipe doesn't have a baking temp on it. can you add that to the recipe?

Just finished cooking/eating. Have to respectfully disagree - the mushrooms in mine were the dominant flavor by far. Very aromatic as well. Interesting and satisfying meal.
