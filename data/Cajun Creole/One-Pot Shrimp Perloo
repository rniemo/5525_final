One of my favorite recipes. We've made it multiple times since having it in a box. I purchase the Penzy's Cajun spice and use a little less. Thanks for giving me a great idea to add to my easy-to-make dinners.

I wish I had read the other reviews before making this and cooked it with stock instead of water. The result with water was bland bland bland. I salvaged it by turning it into a soup. I added 2 quarts stock, 1 chicken sausage (added a smoky flavor that was missing), jerk seasoning and a few tablespoons of white balsamic vinegar for more acidity. I would definitely suggest to change the recipe from water to stock.

The shrimp I received had a strong metallic odor and flavor that overpowered the spice in this dish, which I was surprised at because there is a lot of spice in this dish! I am concerned about the quality of the shrimp I received and wasn't able to stomach eating them. It's a shame, I thought the other flavors of this dish were nice, although a little more spice than I am used to eating. I will be calling customer service to report my concerns, as this is the second shrimp recipe I have received in recent weeks that had the metallic taste.

This was excellent. I love a good bit of heat and it was not too much for me. To get extra flavor in the base, substitute the water for vegtable, chicken, or seafood stock (broth is okay but stock preferred). Also add in 1/4 cup of white wine to the rice and spice roasting step, simmer for 1-2 minutes, then add your tomatoes, etc. I never cook with water! Stock + wine is a fail safe way to get more flavor out of these types of dishes.

I thought this was really excellent. I added half the spice packet when directed - with the rice - and none with the shrimp; I wanted to make sure the spice cooked enough and wasn't overwhelming. I also added a tablespoon of butter at the end, which gave a little bit of creaminess, sort of like risotto.

If you're still planning to make this, I would advise plenty of salt at every step. This is a lot of food, and tomatoes especially love and benefit from salt. If the dish tastes bland, that's probably why.

Made this tonight, and thought it was wonderful. Had read the comments, and as a result, used not only the whole spice packet, but also doused it with my own paprika, cayenne, etc., because, as far as I'm concerned, the spicier, the better. (Also more than doubled the garlic, because...garlic is awesome.)

This, to me, was a perfect meal. I've just eaten about six times more than I really needed because of the taste...yes, I made it spicier, but I can't imagine it would be any less pleasurable for those who don't like spice, if you just adjust it to your preferences, the same way you would with anything you cook.

We thought this was a great version of the low country shrimp and rice classic. Love the spice, and the holy trinity flavors were spot on. For a dish like this, you need to slowly sweat those aromatics to release their falvor w/o burning. That's the key to one pot dishes like this. Wine and stock are good, but we did water and it worked well. I will say that for those that don't like spice, you may want to try one of the other meal delivery services - BA has the most interesting and diverse meal selection of the lot, and that includes spice and intensity sometimes.

Very easy recipe & clean-up! I keep being amazed by how easy it is to cook shrimp via these BA shrimp recipes. It's not something I normally cook on my own.

It was a bit spicy for my taste. I only like a "mild" spice level. The spice level here was tolerable (probably a "medium"), but I had to keep taking breaks while eating to let the spiciness on my tongue die down so I couldn't shovel it down like I wanted to, lol. Next time I'm going to taste any spice blends that seem spicy ahead of time and halve it if it seems too spicy. But other than the spiciness which faded away, it left the best taste in my mouth! The spice level didn't overwhelm the flavors.

Lots of leftovers with this one! I've had at least 4 meals out of it and still have 1 left. I've been poaching eggs and eating them on top of the rice for breakfast. This helps cut the spiciness and is DELICIOUS!

I guess this spice thing is really a matter of taste. So many people warned against what they said was over the top spice, so I cut spice in half. We found it really bland. I had plenty left over so I added all the extra spice just to that part and still did not find it particularly spicy.

This meal ended up in the trash. The general comment was "Spicy bowl of garbage". Too spicy and bland at the same time. Going to have to start skipping weeks when these recipes are in my queue. The other one that was terrible as well was the one with "dirty rice". All I could taste was spicy dust.

This dish is what it is! Great! I see a lot of negative comments... I think If you didn't let the rice roast enough with the pepper, onion, celery and garlic, then you probably missed out on the taste. You can over roast it too and miss out on the taste.... I added a little bit of my own, for my taste but over all...Tasty! My only critique, is use okra instead of the celery...

This was good. It's spicy, but really not that bad. And if you season it appropriately w salt throughout, it's not bland. You just have to taste it and adjust the seasoning, like you would with any other recipe.

I live and New Oleans and the seasoning of this dish was horrible. It was simply flat heat; no flavor. My friend who enjoys spicy food even commented that it was "hot and flavorless."

On the upside, the rice was tasty and the dish was easy to prepare.

I made this meal tonight and was very disappointed. I saw some comments about the how hot the spices were so I used about half the spice mix as I don't like much spice. It was REALLY bland otherwise. It made a lot of food and my husband and I barely ate two plates and tossed the leftovers. I signed up for BA to avoid bland/boring meals and this was very underwhelming.

Easy and tasty dish. We don't like too much spice so I didn't add the green pepper and too much spice. It was a big dish so we have leftovers which is fine by me because I don't like to cook every day. I was a little concern in not cooking the shrimp before adding but it did cook and tasted good.

We enjoyed this, but I only used a scant tablespoon of the spice and even then it's right on the border of my spice tolerance. My spice-loving husband found it perfect.

I'd definitely agree with the others below who said this was an odd combination of spicy AND bland. I enjoy spicy food but the flavor of this had no complexity to it beyond "kinda hot." It did taste a bit better the next day after the flavors had time to meld or settle (I'm single but do two-person meals so I have leftovers to take for lunch the next day), but still didn't particularly enjoy this recipe. Unfortunately, this went way beyond the normal 2 servings and was more like 4. The final one I had to just throw out because it smelled off somehow. (I'm beginning to suspect that cooked celery and I are not good friends - I had a similar issue with a bolognese recipe from BA a month or so ago...) Also, was NOT impressed with having to de-vein about a third of the shrimp that were allegedly supposed to be "ready to cook" from the package...

A few recommendations- Use tomato paste! This would have been inedible spicy with all of the packet. Thank goodness for these comments. I added a pinch. Literally 1/10 of the packet and it was SPICY. recipe was saved with a small can of tomato paste!!! I think a much better fit than chicken stock. With the can of tomato paste and lots of salt this was pretty great, and also thickened up nicely. 1/5 stars otherwise. Also the rice mixture made enough for 4 people. So instead of adding the shrimp to cook in the perloo, I sautéed them in a separate pan and just added them on top so I wasn't trying to fish the shrimp out for the two of us. We had a ton of leftover perloo. The people saying that the recipe wasn't that spicy makes me think that some of us received a different spice ratio, . It would have been NASTY with the entire packet.

I'm not sure if I went awry somewhere in the recipe, but I did not like this meal at all. I didn't find it spicey (used the entire packet) or flavorful at all.

In 2 months, this is the first dish I have been dissapointed with. Again, I echo the comments on the spicing - too much heat and not enough flavor. The flavor that was there was dirty tasting and the texture was bizarre. My shrimp smelled fresh, but I had to devein 1/3 and the texture was mushy. I had a small bowl and fed the rest to the dog......dog didn't much enjoy it either. Looking forward to next week - we still love Blue Apron!

Flavor profile was okay; the spices used had far too much capsaicin for my tastes, but it was edible in that regard. The texture profile, however, was just awful. I mean, I get that perloo is a mishmash of mush, and shrimp is a traditional Cajun portion of this dish, but that texture profile is what made this dish inedible for me.

Also, I threw away the green pepper because that would have only made the dish a thousand times worse.

My husband really liked it. It was borderline spicy for me, but tasty. We used about 2/3 of a Tablespoon in the pot, and then used 1/2 a teaspoon to coat the shrimp. We actually measured the spice mix, and what we noticed is that the card said there was 1.5 Tablespoons of spice. We used just under 1 T and there was a lot (over half) left. So, I think if you dump the whole spice pack in, you're getting a lot more than the recipe calls for. From now on, when the ingredient list mentions an amount of spice, we'll measure to that.

We also used chicken stock instead of water.

I liked this dish. I think the complaints about the spiceness have to do with adding the spice mixture to the shrimp at the end before stirring them into the pot. I found the rice to be have a mild kick but when I bit into the shrimp there was a more spice flavor. I don't mind because I like spicy but for those that are sensitive, you might just want to season the shrimp with just salt and pepper before adding to the pot. The rice could have had more flavor so I wished I had used chicken stock as recommended by another reviewer. This cooks up a lot of food, I was surprized it was only 2 servings.

I find the spices/flavorings to be lacking in "wow" factor. I agree with Rodrigo (below) who said it was "too spicy and bland at the same time." The spices may be on the right track, but very often (not just this dish) I find that there is too much of "this", and not enough of "that". I am sympathetic to the remarks of some who for medical or other reasons cannot tolerate bold and spicy flavors, but the solution for that is to cut WAY back on the spice packets provided. For others (like me), I wish BA would UP the intensity so we can actually taste the special ingredients. I vote for more...See More

After reading through all these tips I put together everyone's ideas and my meal came out great! I don't like my food really spicy so this had a great amount of kick without making it unbearable.
1. Started with 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3
2. Added 1 tbsp of the spice mix to the pot and reserved the rest
3. Put in two chicken bouillon cubes with the water
4. Patted the shrimp dry, put it in a ziploc bag and tossed it with a little bit of olive oil, the rest of the spice mix, salt and pepper and then threw it in a hot frying pan for 2 minutes (be sure to move them around frequently otherwise they'll stick/burn)
5. Added the shrimp to the pot after letting it cool way down so the shrimp didn't continue to cook

My husband was very unimpressed with this meal. He said it tasted like anything else we eat. We got blue apron because we are bored of same old foods. The cod and cauliflower salad was the best along with the pork chop and cabbage/potatoes was his top favorites.

The shrimp I recieved wasn't fresh. It had black spots along the plastic lining that looked like mold. Couldn't make the dish because, even though it looked delicious

I also added chicken broth to this (as opposed to water, as directed in the recipe) and I thought the result was good. Consistency was very similar to risotto which I liked a lot.

This was not spicy, nor flavorful, just HOT! A real disappointment because I love shrimp too.

Would order again. Thank you for the consistently interesting offerings of thoughtful cooking.

I thought it was okay but my husband refused to finish his bowl because it was too bland. He requested no more Blue apron cajun dishes (we love Cajun food).

I really enjoyed this recipe. I must admit I made up my own version of the spice mix. I'm always a little shy of cayenne pepper, so I made my own using equal parts of the rest of the spices. I hadn't thought about the fix sauce, I'll try some in my leftovers.

Ok, I'm going to preface this by saying I was ravenous, so my review may be biased! I usually make the meals, but my husband made this one and it was waiting for me when I got home. It was not too spicy for me; in fact, I added chili paste to mine! Here are a few tips: Don't dump in all of the seasoning. Season little by little and keep tasting as you cook! My husband added all of the spice, but we like spicy foods. Add more garlic if you like it or keep adding other spices. My husband added Sazon seasoning (achiote con cilantro). He also added the included parsley, but on my SECOND helping, I also added fresh cilantro and basil. You may need to add a sprig or two of something to taste, but this is delicious! And there is a ton left. There is enough for 2-3 more servings of leftovers.

Easy to make and heavy on the spices. Next time I will add stock rather than water, as the flavor is a little thin.

Liked this a lot as a basic recipe altho it was bland and needed a good shot of Tabasco for my taste. Also I thought it was really cheap of BA to send farmed shrimp rather than wild shrimp. Made it twice more (with higher quality shrimp), including on a camping trip, for which I prepped everything in advance. Used pearl rice (with amount of water called for on the package), added andouille sausage and diced chicken. First time I used packaged creole spice that was way too salty. Second time I made spice blend from scratch. That hit the spot...Next time I will use chicken broth instead of water..

Haven't cooked this yet but looking at the ingredients makes me wonder why some have found this 'bland' or 'tasteless' (or even TOO spicy - but no taste). I've made versions of this myself and always come up with a very tasty dish. The spices they use are similar to the spices I've also used myself. So, what's missing? I would suggest adding a sliced sausage, maybe andouille or sweet italian. Brown the sausage FIRST, then add other ingredients. I probably cook with twice as much garlic. Also, the spice mix is provided on the card - they are very common spices - use the ones you like most - and in the amounts you like most. Just suggestions!

I cooked it and ate it but I changed a lot of things because of what people said. I used only about 1/2 teaspoon of the spice blend. I added my own spices: oregano, coriander, cumin and paprika. The oregan made a HUGE difference in the taste. Not cajun but it improved it. I think I should have cooked it with a few bay leaves--that would have given it a nice flavor. I added about 1/4 cup of leftover olive brine and that gave it some body too. Now that I think about it, some butter might have helped. But what I ended up with was edible although not great. I didn't like the taste of the shrimp. I guess I have been eating farmed shrimp for so long I don't know what is good. I also cooked the shrimp in the pot with everything.

I enjoyed it. I did add more cayenne, white and black pepper. Husband found it bland with flat heat (boring cayenne without balancing flavors). Next time, I would add more thyme and oregano, garlic, and a bay leaf or two. Good flavors, just need more of them. The rice was great and the liquid proportion was dead on. It was definitely dinner for four, not two.

Learned my lesson with previous spice packs and added the seasoning very sparingly. Used only about a quarter of the amount and it was still pretty spicy for us. Green pepper was mostly mush, used what I could then added some chopped red bell pepper. Also added a little tomato paste for flavor; it helped offset the spice. Overall it was pretty good; not our favorite but not awful.

I have to agree with many of the negative comments here. This meal was almost inedible. I did add steamed broccoli and threw away most of the rice to make the dish more nutritious and enjoyable. One of the problems was the use of rice made for Risotto. When making a Risotto, the rice is toasted in olive oil. (If you followed the recipe here, you would have too many vegetables in the pan for the rice to toast properly). Once the rice it toasted, Risotto requires adding a little water at a time and stirring constantly to bring it to its natural creamy consistency. This rice is loaded with...See More

Blue Apron - please please please do not put dried herbs in a spice blend when you could send fresh! I was apprehensive about this recipe because I usually find pre-mixed cajun spice blends to be flat and sort of muddy tasting, usually because of the dried oregano, and this was no exception. The lemon juice was a nice thought but totally insufficient to brighten up these flavors. I also used salt at every prep stage because I anticipated the problem but it was still just one-note and awful. Way too much rice and I don't feel right throwing a giant pot of food away, so will be glumly getting through this over the next few days... : (

I may add some fresh crumbled chorizo tonight and see if it helps with the zing and texture factor.

Thanks for labeling the shrimp, though?

Agree with the prior poster...I thought this was pretty bland despite the touch of heat. Used water, should have gone for chicken broth & some wine as others suggested. Have plenty of leftovers for tonight as it made a lot, maybe I'll try adding a bit of italian sausage.

I don't like much heat. So per previous suggestions I added 2 chicken bullion cubes when I added the water to the pot. I only added one teaspoon of the spice blend. I seasoned the shrimp with only one teaspoon of the spice blend and then added some of my own seasonings. I sauteed the shrimp in a spoon of bacon fat for a couple minutes until cooked and then added them to the pot. It turned out pretty good. Definitely large portions though, maybe 3-4 meals of this.

We loved this! Followed advice (including my own) and browned some sausage in oil before adding other ingredients - doubled up on garlic (personal taste) -- drained sausage and used font to saute the vegetables - (added sausages back at the end) - tasted seasoning before adding -- added for taste (about 1/2 packet) -- and used chicken stock in place of water. Served four easily! It was amazingly good!

Like others said, this wasn't too spicy, so I actually added cayenne on my own. Next time I would add a bit more garlic as well, but I liked it well enough to keep the recipe and add my own adjustment notes for the future.

This was good - with a few modifications after reading suggestions here.

My green pepper arrived crushed - mostly usable - but I added a half a red bell pepper as well. I doubled the garlic and sauteed the onion and garlic for about 5 minutes before adding the peppers (to get some caramelization to help with flavor).

I measured the spice blend (because I've so often had things so off from the recipe). Asking for 3/4 of 1.5 tablespoons spice doesn't make it easy, but 1.5 Tb is 4.5 tsp, so I put just over 3 tsp spice blend in with the veggies and sauteed that for a few minutes before adding t...See More

First time trying Blue Apron, turned out really well. I added slightly too much water I think. I'd probably go with 3 cups of water and add extra at the end if needed. Definitely has a kick to it!

Great dish. Added some hot italian sausage as suggested by some previous reviews, and substitued vegetable stock for the 3.5 cups of water. I turned out very good, and it came out to be 4 large servings.
