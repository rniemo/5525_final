All three recipes this week have hot spices in them. There are people who don't like HOT. You need to consider that. We had to throw the beef meraquez away last week!

I'm an omnivore but also must cook this for a vegetarian. I'm going to blacken a half inch slice of firm tofu ( lightly marinated in a nori broth) for him.

I am a huge Blue Apron fan and have adjusted the heat on some of the recipes, I didn't know what to expect with the meraquez a few weeks ago so only used a little of the spice and then regretted not using more. So live and learn!

While the meal came together quite beautifully, I was not a fan of the drum fish. Honestly, it left a sort of plasticine aroma in the mouth. Salmon probably would've been nice for this.

I was so sad to have to skip this box! This dish looks heavenly and really simple to prepare. I doubt my grocery store will have drum on hand, what other fish would you recommend to go with this meal? Is drum similar to catfish? Cod? Halibut?

I actually thought the grits were sinfully bland, and the herb salad in my box was about a quarter the size of the pictured dish :/ I loved what I had of the salad and the fish, but there really needed to be something to help those grits, and I even added some spices on my own to try to save them. I really wanted to like this one more than I did.

Does anyone know if the fish is farmed or wild?

Anyone know how many ounces the drum filets were? I should have weighed them!

This was the first time that I did not enjoy the meal. It likely was the choice of fish. I also thought that the grits needed a bit more flavor. Just a few thoughts....

This one was not for us. Fish was fishy (inedible for our taste), grits were terribly bland, and the salad (which said it should have 4 sorrel leaves but only 1 came) was less than average. We're using this as a way to try out fish since neither of us grew up eating it - and typically if we don't love the fish, we'll quickly cook a chicken breast to make up for it. This meal was not great all around (took a complete dumpster dive and now we're ordering in) but it's only the 2nd meal we haven't liked, so the value overall is still great.

my first BA meal - have to say, it was "meh". Grits were very bland. I only received 2 sorrel leaves - would have loved more "salad". Fish was alright, but not something I'd choose to eat again.

loved the fish, though i prefer long cooking grits instead of the quick kind. sadly, we also got a single sorrel leaf! This dish needed a quarter pound of spinach and it would have been just great.

This was my first Blue Apron recipe and I thought that the grits were bland. I had never cooked grits before to know how to make them otherwise I would have made them with milk and butter and added the salt at the beginning as someone else suggested. I got to much cajun seasoning on the fish. This recipe needed lots of help!

My first Blue Apron meal :-) Also, first time eating grits. The cheese helped with flavor and we also added some dried red pepper. Really liked the blackened, Cajun-style fish! Agree that the meal needed more greens to be called a salad!

I only received one sorrel leaf, and there were so much grits. The fish was great though.

I think I should have cooked this one first as the fish got darker in color instead of a nice white color so I tossed the fish. I have some frozen tilapia in the freezer that I'll use with the grits.

This was the first time my dish turned out just like the picture, so I was proud of that. Never had grits, and I don't think I will again. The texture wasn't to my taste. But the fish was AMAZING!! More cajun stuff, Blue Apron!

This dish was just OK, not great, for us. The grits were not particularly flavorful and we received one, lonely little sorrel leaf - so I'm still not sure whether or not I like sorrel.

Loved the grits and the drum, and would probably make this dish again LEAVING OUT the sorrel, parsley and chive salad and perhaps just use chives. For us, the vinegar was a little too overpowering for this dish.

Not super excited about this one, but it came out wonderful. I love all of the flavors - thy went perfectly together and my finished product looked very Top Chef worthy.

This recipe is fantastic. When I make it again I will add more cheese to the grits, because they were a bit bland, but cooled the cajun just perfectly. I loved the sorrel salad, too.

I would never think of putting this combo together. It worked out well and was really delicious! The meal was very hearty without being too heavy

Almost every BA dish has been a winner, but this one didn't really work. I thought the grits were way too bland - I added an embarrassing amount of parmesan to make them cheesier - and I didn't love the texture of the fish. I thought the herb topping was great, though!
