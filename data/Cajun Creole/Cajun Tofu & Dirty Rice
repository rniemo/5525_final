Super delicious. I put the sauteed veggies, rice, water, and tomatoes in my rice cooker, and it worked like a charm (though it took about half an hour). Remember to add a fair amount of salt to the dirty rice; the tomatoes taste flat without it. I also recommend taking ten minutes or so to dry your tofu - wrap it in paper towels, put a plate or cookie sheet on top, and put several cans or cookbooks on top of that. You want to push out as much moisture as possible. I didn't love the okra, but I think I needed hotter oil to get a better crunch on the outside - make sure you let your oil really heat up for that lovely crispiness.

I also had trouble with the rice taking much longer than the recipe stated. I was wondering if I had my heat too low.... my rice was still crunchy by the time it was supposed to be done. Added a lot more water and it improved but was never really fluffy. The flavor was very good and we really enjoyed the tofu and even the okra (not the biggest fan of okra).

This recipe wasn't a home run like some of the others recipes I have tried on Blue Apron but it was very good.

First time visiting the site after seeing a commercial this morning. I Really like it.

Wonderful. Recommend omiting tofu, doubling the rice (brown) & spice blend, adding hot sauce.

Is there any plan to add a VEGAN choice??? My husband is a VEGAN, so there are many times when the VEGETARIAN meals aren't an option for us.

I used 2 1/4 cups water for the rice. Recipe calls for extra firm tofu but I got firm tofu with my delivery, which didn't crisp as well.

I knew as soon as I saw the rice that the water suggested would be inadequate. But I went ahead thinking maybe they knew something I didn't, like the large amount of veg and tomato would compensate. Nope. After 15 minutes I had to heat water and continue. As a result the rice had bad texture. I though this recipe was horrible.

This is a lot of rice. I also had to double the amount of water for the rice to finish cooking. I think that 3/4 cup of rice would have been plenty. Also, the calorie count seems to have been calculated using 1 1/4 cup of cooked rice rather than dry rice. When I calculated the nutrition info it came out to 900+ calroies per serving (based on 2 servings). Although, this made more than two servings for us. We did like the flavor and will probably make this recipe again.

Totally agree with Kathleen. The rice took more than double the time than what the recipe specified (and I live in NJ so no altitude issues here). We had to add a lot more liquid to the rice so it didn't stick to the pot (we used vegetable stock to not dilute the flavor too much). The tofu and okra got cold and soggy waiting for the rice to finish. We also added cayenne pepper to the rice to give it a little more kick (just a personal preference). Overall, pretty good recipe, just figure in more time for the rice when cooking it.

I feel like these recipes aren't being tested very well. We also had to more than double the water. Also got firm and not extra firm tofu. As well, not enough spice; pretty bland (the tofu in particular). Hot sauce helped.

Didn't love it. Not a lot of flavor.

As everyone said, it needed more like 2 cups of added water than 1. I went about 1 3/4.

The amount of tofu is pretty overwhelming and crisping it up was tough, though Arianna's tip below probably would have helped me. I don't cook with it much.

This is delicious! The texture of the tofu is great, and the spice profile was perfect.

Just a quick note, I needed to add WAY more water to the rice in step 3 (I think at least 1 cup) before it was fluffy, and it took probably double the suggested time to cook. I'm in Denver, so sometimes need to adjust cooking times slightly for the altitude, but this seemed like a pretty extreme case.

I also had to double the water and cook for longer than listed. Did we perhaps get more rice than intended?

I have found that I now add way more water than BA recommends for most recipes (and more oil in most cases). Seems like the recipes are a bit off when it comes to liquids.

My rice comes out perfect every time. Maybe people arent covering their pots very well or are letting their pots boil for too long. Ive never had any issues with not having enough liquid for a dish. Ive made this one 3 times already and comes out perfect every time.

So glad that I read the comments first and I doubled the water for the rice. Also used the suggestion to wrap the tofu in paper towels and set some weight on it to squeeze out excess moisture.

I added some cajun spice that I had picked up in N'awlins and the result was super tasty.

Glad I read the comments on the rice because it did need more water and cooking time. I used the entire spice packet and thought it was incredibly bland. Not a favorite recipe in this house.

A decent recipe. I love okra, and spicy, and both in combination. Holy goodness was this ever a lot of rice, though.
