It was very good except for the tomatoes! It is prime tomato season, and without fail, every tomato in every recipe is anemic in color and taste. I throw them away and buy my own tomatoes. I think you need a new tomato supplier.

LOVED this dish. A couple tips - no need to wipe the pan after the shrimp. I just added a bit of extra oil and kept going with the aromatics and that meant keeping the extra paprika in, which was nice. I did use a cup of broth for part of the water in the grits. I used half the lemon zest in the grits and the other half with the tomato and only half my not-very-juicy lemon and that was just right. I also added an extra garlic clove. In future, I'd dice up a zucchini and toss it in with the tomato to beef up the vegetable factor. My shrimp tasted fine - BA shrimp took on a really bad bleach/chlorine flavor a while back and they took it off the menu for a while but mine has been fine since it came back. I'm guessing that wild Gulf shrimp has to be cleaned because of the BA disaster, but at least for us it's been fine lately.

Blue Apron, this recipe was off-the-hook good! Smoked paprika is my current crush for spices. This was super easy to make. I made one ONE little tweak on the grits... and added a splash of heavy cream. I know, I know... extra calories. We love polenta, and I make it often, and that's how I get creamy polenta. I loved the flavor of the shrimp, and I plan to make this recipe again. Only, I will double the fresh corn, and maybe kick up the cheddar a bit more. I have to admit, I'm not wild about the BA shrimp... I can't pin it down, but there's a sort of "off" flavor... not that it's spoiled. It kind of has a note of "bleach" flavor. I'm lucky enough to buy good quality Texas shrimp from my fish monger, so I'll buy that next time. Oh, and this time, I thought there was PLENTY of food for the two of us!

We especially liked the smoked paprika on the shrimp. The thing that I would most like to see in future meals is infomation on the sourcing of each ingredient.

This recipe was delicious! There are always too many grits for me in these recipes so I only used half of the grits (with half water and half broth) and it was the perfect amount for us.This would cut back the calories too for those that have mentioned the high calorie count and leave you with enough grits for another recipe.

This shrimp and grits dish was awesome! Easy to make, no need to wipe the pan out after cooking shrimp to cook the onion and garlic - just add a little more oil and continue the flavor. I did add extra garlic but I do that with every recipe I make. We've had this dish many times in New Orleans and Blue Apron nailed it!!! WOW!

This was my first BA meal, and I am . . . underwhelmed. First off, this was lot of work--more prep than the 15 minutes claimed on the recipe. It took a lot of prep dishes/bowls, and cleaning these up is my least favorite part of cooking. Then, the grits were nearly tasteless--except for the LEMON. Oh my gosh, that was a lot of LEMON, even though I reduced the lemon juice in the shrimp by half. The shrimp were . . . okay. But I have done much better on my own. The tomato was awful--an anemic piece of styrofoam. A friend had sent me a free week of Blue Apron, and I am tempted to cease delivery. But I do want to give it a chance, so I will see what the remaining recipes hold. I am really disappointed.

So having 3 new recipes a week and getting to use ingredients I've never used before is really nice. I'm just a bit disappointed about the beef dishes, until now it was just ground beef and I was hoping to receive a beautiful steak every once in a while but checking the next weeks recipes it seems it is not in the plans.

I ended up revamping this dish after a friend who also gets BA said that it was the not the shrimp and grits we are accustomed to here on the Gulf Coast of Florida. I rinsed my shrimp and then tossed it in the lemon juice and patted dry to remove that beachy taste I had in my last BA shrimp dish. I cooked my grits in chicken broth then added a splash of heavy cream, butter, a little extra cheese and a dash of Worcestershire. I used the paprika and Cajun seasonings on the shrimp and topped the dish with a little pepper sauce. It was the spicy cheesy dish that I know-- delish! I really loved the crunch and texture that the addition of the corn kernels gave to the grits!

Prefacing this tip with the fact that I am not from the south and lack appreciation for grits. I followed the directions exactly for the grits and thought the lemon flavor was overpowering, but otherwise bland. I would use half or even leave out the lemon zest. I didn't even really taste the cheese that I worked so hard to grate, lol!
Also used a tip from someone to use half the lemon on the shrimp and I still felt it was a bit tart and lemony. Would consider only squeezing 1/4 of the lemon then adding more at the end of more of that flavor is desired.
Smoked paprika on the shrimp was pretty tasty though! Doubt I would make ever again but fun to try new things :)

We LOVED this recipe - SO good!!! We actually get really good produce b/c we're in CA. No need to clean the pan after cooking the shrimp (which only needs a copule of minutes!) and the only thing I wish this had was some smoky bacon or pancetta (Southern girl here!) to top it off, so, I added a touch of bacon drippings to the grits to give it that smoky bacony flavor but the whole shebang would have just really elevated it!

So I'm sad to say but I had to improvise on this dish as I was missing the knick nacks, thankfully we keep butter and shredded cheese on hand. I was fortunate I had JUST enough smoked paprika in my spice rack to season the shrimp. Was my second dish from this week missing something, but I will say it wasn't too bad, just really heavy. And of course the shrimp just had this off smell about them... so if I make this again I will definitely cut back on the grits, get truly fresh shrimp, and of course more things to experiment with, because it's a recipe that could go more towards the spicy side of life.

So, since both portions are for me, I prepared just half the shrimp tonight and will prepare the other half tomorrow. But I did prepare all of the grits. I left the second portion in a bowl on the counter to cool while I ate my dinner. I was surprised to find the bowl of grits on the counter all congealed and one sold chunk. Any ideas on how to reheat the grits tomorrow and restore them to the proper consistency?

Threw the entire thing in the garbage.

Total disappointment.

The shrimp, as soon as I cut open the bag, the stink of a strong chemical smell and fishy shrimp. I tried. I wash the shrimp 4 times under water and even used paper towels twice.

Still the smell was over powering. I tried to season the smell away, but even when I plated that stink was still there, a chemical smell. The shrimp were poor quality.

Pretty decent recipe - yes I am sure it's not "authentic." Shrimp were fine; I always give them a good one minute rinse, so never have bleach-smell issues.

I, too, did not wipe the pan from shrimp to vegetables; just added in a tiny bit of water with the tomato to keep everything from sticking and it worked out fine. Threw in a bit of half and half with the butter and cheese because why not? I had no problem with the lemon content and flavor, but everyone is different.

Corn was good, tomato definitely could have been better. BA could solve that problem by sourcing both from the great state of New Jersey.

This was sooooo delicious, but I definitely did not eat all the grits. I had problems with the grits - they were super bland without adding 1 million mg of salt (exaggerating). But once I got it seasoned well enough, they were good. They also ended up seizing up after sitting out for a while so I had to add about a cup more liquid to get them to the right consistency. I used half chicken broth half water. I also did not like the smell of the shrimp so I used frozen shrimp I already had. I figured it expired since I didn't use them till a week after I recieved and I neglected to freeze them.

What a disappointment, the shrimp were awful... I could smell a strong odor when I first opened them, but after reading some reviews below I thought it was probably just the way they were preserved so I washed them good and continued to cook. That first bite I knew something was really wrong, don't know if maybe my shrimp were spoiled or just the way they were preserved but they weren't edible. The grits alone were tasty and the smoked paprika would have been a nice combo if not for the bad shrimp, so the recipe would be good if duplicated with quality seafood. Not selecting another shrimp meal until I figure out what happened.

Made this last night and it was great! I made a few changes however: 2 cups of chicken stock and 1 cup of water for the grits, I also seasoned the grits with some garlic powder, Tony's Creole seasoning, salt and pepper. I saw some comments about he shrimp tasting weird so I decided to wash it a bit after I took it out of the package. It did have a weird texture to it, but I think that is because of it being vacum sealed. I seasoned it with just a touch of the smoked paprika, added some Tony's Creole seasoning and minced garlic with it. I only used half of the lemon juice as well. It turned out perfectly! I am not a big grits eater but I did like this recipe.

Question: How long will the shrimp stay good in the packaging? I wish all the meat packaging had a "use by" date. The ground chicken and beef both say "use within 9 days of receiving" and that would be helpful on all proteins.

Usually I feel compelled to use seafood right away but since this shrimp is shrink wrapped, I'm wondering if that extends its freshness? This is a time intensive dish so I couldn't cook it right away with a busy schedule this week. Threw the shrimp in the freezer tonight - got the delivery on Tuesday. Wondering if I didn't have to freeze it and could have left it in the fridge...

I believe this dish is now one of my top favorite BA dishes. I did, however, make a couple changes. No self-respecting Southerner (I'm from East Tennessee, now living in Southwest Virginia) would put corn or lemon in their grits. Ever. I omitted both and made sure they were salted properly. Secondly based on other reviews, I only added the lemon zest to the tomato shrimp mixture and served lemon wedges on the side. It was all lick the bowl delicious. I served a small cucumber tomato salad made from veggies from the garden on the side.

This dish was okay, and while I'm a little underwhelmed by it, it is definitely something I want to try and make again with some tweaks. Normally I'm not a fan of grits, but this was pretty tasty with the corn. My only adjustments to these would be some more cheese and maybe a little more lemon; I got small hints of both but I found myself wanting a bit more.

The shrimp is the real letdown of this dish. I absolutely love shrimp, but there's a reason this has been only my second shrimp dish so far. The shrimp itself has this chemically/fishy odor to them that permeates through the entire dish,...See More

We skipped this week but wanted to try this recipe. We bought the ingredients and cooked it. It was fantastic. I pride myself on my shrimp and grits but these were better. I didn't like the idea of the lemon zest being added to the grits but it turned out better than expected. Not sure what grits would have been shipped for the meal but our basic yellow stone ground grits turned out well. I always add a little milk (maybe a couple of tablespoons) to my grits to make them creamy. All in all, one of the best meals yet.

This was my 3rd week with BA and we have been really pleased with most of the meals so far, except the seafood.

I have been with BA for over a year now, and this was by far the worst dish I have tried hands down! In fact, I ended up throwing it out after a few bites despite being unbelievably hungry. I agree with some of the other posts regarding the shrimp- it definitely has an "off" smell as well as taste, as if it was spoiled... despite cooking it immediately after delivery. Maybe BA should look into a new shrimp distributer as this is not the first time I have noticed it.

This was one of the best yet. I didn't use all the paprika since we don't like things to be too spicy. The tomato was not the best so I used a good farm market tomato that I already had.

This Southern girl loved this one!!! While I agree that the tomato was less "tomato"-ish, I liked the mildness in this dish as I think it would have been too acidic with a more legit tomato, what with all the lemon.

My lemon had the most seeds of any lemon I've ever seen. So maybe my dish wasn't as acidic due to the lack of actual juice from my seedy lemon and the tomato.

At any rate, superb. Loved this one.

This was pretty good. I loved the grits with fresh sweet corn, and really enjoyed the added flavor that the lemon added to the dish.

The lemon really overpowers this dish. I'd save the effort and skip the zest, then halve the lemon. Both the cheddar and butter add nothing to this dish. Ditch them for a much lower calorie count.

Loved this dish. However; the shrimp was already thawed out by the time it arrived so it was bad and we had to throw it out. Where would I find the grits they are so good.

I didn't love this one. I am normally a huge fan of shrimp and grits, but this dish tasted a bit "soapy." I think it needed more heat spice, and less lemon juice.

The lemon practically ruined the grits. Do yourself a favor and skip adding the lemon to this dish at all. The shrimp was lovely, though.

This was delicious, but I think the polenta was a bit on the bland side and could have used more cheese and seasoning. But the shrimp was excellent!

The cheese grits were to die for, but what is with the awful shrimp? It is borderline mushy and nearly tasteless. The texture made me feel borderline nauseated. Yuk.

I sauteed 1/2 onion and a medium pepper, then add the garlic and paprika for a minute. To that I added the tomato for 2 minutes and then the unseasoned shrimp. The technique in the recipe is fine, but overly complicated and left the sauteed shrimp to get rubbery while you do the rest. Oh, and no southerner would add lemon to grits in this.

So disappointed! -- Was really looking forward to this one. The grits were terrific, but the shrimp, not so much; had a very metallic taste (even after several rinses), which the lemon only seemed to enhance and not much else in the way of flavor. Doubled the garlic, could have used a lot more scallion and sother pices! The tomato I was sent looked like it needed to stay on the vine for about another month, so I used one that I had picked up from the local farmers market. I only cooked up half the recipe – will throw out the rest of the shrimp and use some andouille sausage instead.

I thought the recipe was easy to follow and the timing pretty much on target. The paprika shrimp + sauce was wonderful and I plan on making that again. We liked the corn in the grits because it added a crunch factor the dish needed, however, we're not a fan of grits. The mouth feel of the grits was a little off putting to us. Even with the cheese in it, it had little flavor. We ended up mixing the sauce in it and then it was good. Of course we thought there was WAY too much grits, but we ate it. :)

My husband is a hearty eater and I generally split our BA meals 2/3 for him 1/3 for me. The shrimp to grits ratio was off on this one. It left me with 4 TINY shrimp. With that said I would make this again but add more shrimp. Grits could have used about 2 more ounces of cheese or maybe a sharper cheddar. Loved the lemon taste that others have complained about.

Very tasty delicious dish. I couldn't finish the portion of grits, it was enough to bathe in! For my taste, the smoke paprika was kind of heavy, so when this comes around again, I'll use maybe half of it. This recipe could easily have served 3 adults. One thing, a personal desire, I wish BA would just send the cheese already grated. Grating that little block of cheese does nothing for me to make me feel "cheffy" and cleaning the cheese grater is a pain. And, like the other time I had their shrimp, it's defiinitely worth the few minutes to look at each shrimp to make sure they are all deveined. I found a few once again that needed a little more attention.

This turned out well for me. The shrimp needed to be well rinsed but were good. Given the suggestions posted, I used the zest in the grits but not the lemon juice in the shrimp. Instead, I deglazed with a bit of white wine. I do think it needs more onion.

Re: Comments on Shrimp - I've been in the shrimp business over 30 years so I have some knowledge on this subject. I applaud BA for their efforts on promoting sustainability by sourcing product from a resource that Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program deems as being a "Good Alternative". However, all efforts to source sustainably and responsibly are moot if the product is heavily treated with chemicals. An unfortunate practice in the shrimp industry is to treat shrimp with Sodium Tripolyphosphate. The official public stance on this practice is "to retain moisture" (as often seen in ...See More

Fabulous recipe. I created the green curl topping by stripping the inner raw sides of the green omion tips with a dull knife much like you do paper party ribbon. Viola! BA should invite me to do a guest chef video of my technique, n'est-ce-pas?

Tip: cook down the tomato liquid or at least use a slotted spoon when topping the grits with the shrimp/tomato. Mine was too watery.

This was a fantastic recipe. The grits were amazing and, as always, the shrimp was perfect. Thank you for always sending quality seafood.

Unfortunately we did not care for this dish. While we love cheesy grits and shrimp, we just didn't feel like the two went together very well. The paprika shrimp just over powered the flavor of the cheese grits for us.

Unfortunately, the "off" taste of the shrimp spoiled this dish. I ended up picking out the shrimp and throwing them away after several members of my family complained of the taste. The cheddar grits were good, but could easily have gone without the butter.

we did not get the right spice packet for this- got cajun spice mix vs smoked paprika... unfortunatley I talked my sister into starting blue apron this week and neither of us liked this. She wont be continuing.

Sadly, this dish left me very sad. The shrimp was not "fresh" but very fishy. I was not able to make it the day it arrived, but it should have remain fine for 2 days under refrigeration. My second complaint is the lemon. Citrus in a lot of the recipes. Even after cutting back on the zest, it was overpowering, and I like citrus. I am hoping that this was a one time problem with the shrimp as I have liked the other recipes that have come.

The shrimp was really tasty an complimented the grits. I followed the advice of only using half the lemon and thought it was good, but my boyfriend added the rest. We also added more salt and some sriracha powder to the grits. We agreed it would have been better with more cheese.
