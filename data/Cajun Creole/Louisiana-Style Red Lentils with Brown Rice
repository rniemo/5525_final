I just made this and it was soooo filling. Really delicious. Was enough for two adults + leftovers.

The nice thing: It easily made four servings. The bad thing: It was very bland. Not much of a taste, despite all that went into it. My husband couldn't even finish his because it was dull.

Oh, my. This was really good. I didn't find it "dull" at all. I used ALL of the Cajun seasoning! I like my food with a lot of flavor and while I certainly could have tolerated more spice, I thought it was really good. I did have to add salt while eating.

I also thought that 1teaspoon of Cajun seasoning was not enough so I used Cajun vegetable broth in place of half the water in the rice and one cup of the cajun broth with two cups of water in the lentils. Very tasty.
