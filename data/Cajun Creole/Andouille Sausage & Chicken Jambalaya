I'm making this for six year old who is sensitive to spice levels. How spicy is the andouille style sausage? I might hold it out and add for the others if it is hot. Thanks!

Hi, my wife has a gluten allergy so I plan to substitute rice, should I just add cooked rice to step 5?

I have to say...the pearled barley does NOT work for this recipe. It's way too overpowering of a grain to be in this type of dish.

We really liked this one. We backed off to five cups of water - six would have been too much. Really liked the barley; interesting twist.

This dish is really good! We really liked the barley. I used about 3/4 of the spice packet. It was a little too spicy for my taste but my family loved it! It took about 40 min for the liquid to cook down.

The texture of the barley was distracting. There was not nearly enough flavor - just heat in the spice packet. We had to season it to get it to taste good, not just HOT. Not enough MEAT. The sausage was flavorful, but just barely there. I would love this is done again with rice, and just sausage (no chicken) and actual flavors.

A little bland and not enough meat. But decent.

Hi, out of curiosity is the pan pictured in the "Chef Essential" section actually a saute pan? I was of the belief that saute pans were angular while the one seen above with its sloped sides more closely resembles a skillet?

On a related note, what size pan would you recommend to comfortably hold the ingredients listed here?
