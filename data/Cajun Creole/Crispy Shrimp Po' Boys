Our first disappointing meal. Not hearty enough to feed 4 people. Would not do this one again without enhancing, maybe another side dish. Coleslaw just not filling, nor anything special. Expected better rolls.

This was not our favorite meal. I agree with most of the comments already posted. Also, is it just us, but the meals seem to be skimpier? Definitely not enough food for a family of four. There are only three of us and we rarely have leftovers. My husband liked the shrimp, I thought they were fishy. We won't be making this one again.

This was one of our favorite meals so far, but I agree that I wish it were larger. The poboys are so good, everyone wanted two. Frying the shrimp was much simpler than I expected.

Wasn't that ok excited when I saw this. Had it for lunch with my son. I had 1 and he had 3. It was good for lunch but didn't seem enough to feed my family for dinner

Not that great. First time we received a meal that I would never make again nor even try to spice up to make it work.

We loved the recipe, but only enough for two.
Definitely do not keep the rolls in for 4 minutes or they will be burnt!

This was not a hit with my family. We must be spoiled as far as Po' boys go, because this was probably the most disappointing meal we've had yet. The hot dog buns were fine for hot dogs but not appropriate here. The remoulade was not what I'd expect on a Po' boy. The shrimp coating was wimpy (my daughters words) The slaw did not really match the rest of the meal. I did like the peppers, but that was about it.

Incredibly disappointed in the meal. The buns were of the cheapest quality... I am an adult and have not eaten a hot dog bun in years, this was completely not up to the Blue Apron standards that I have come to expect. The shrimp had no shrimp taste and sadly had a bleach foretaste. Terrible meal.

Didn't care too much for this one.

We really liked the meal - would have prefered something more substantial than a hot dog roll. Also, not enough shrimp!

We loved this meal! It fed 3 of us plus we had dessert.

After reading the negative comments I borrowed heavily from an epicurious recipe and added garlic powder, cayenne, onion powder, smoked paprika and oregano to the shrimp. Then I added 50% cornmeal to the flour. I skipped the cabbage and added capers to the remoulade. I had an avocado on hand and although not traditional on a Po Boy it was a nice addition. After a fresh squeeze of lemon everyone in the family liked it. The shrimp were delicious and I'm glad none of the ingredients went to waste.
