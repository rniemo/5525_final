This meal was 1st delivered the beginning of October. I think I've made it at least 6 times since then. The brown rice does take 40 minutes when I make it. We love this recipe. It's easy to make, tasty and healthy!

I took a week off from my box and browsed through BA's cookbook to get ideas for cooking. Did this one on my own with the following modifications: used jasmine white rice (I don't like brown rice and never use it whenever BA sends it to me), used Wickles pickle relish which is the best relish ever for the tartar sauce, and made my own Cajun spice blend and it was great! I'm kind of glad I did this one on my own as I feel the ingredients I used were better than what my BA box would have provided. Grateful for the service, but sometimes I can get better ingredients (but not delivered to me!).

Looks very interesting. Just so you know, "dirty" rice is made with liver.

The catfish was delicious and the Roulade, which is basically tarter sauce added to the flavor of the fish. Use Lemon! I added lemon to the roulade, just a touch brought out the flavor of the pickle. Also used lemon when cooking the fish. I almost crumbed the fish ( Julie Style, lots of butter) but that may have been NON Cajun, which was the point of the meal. LOL
Definitely coat both sides of the catfish with the flower spice, which makes sense. Give it a good rub on both side. Salt and Pepper a must. Cook for 6 minutes on each side. Add lemon on each flip.
Want to thank my Blue Apron home chef’s about the heads up on cooking the rice- 40 minutes, nothing less. I started the rice early, waited until the rice was 5 minutes done before starting the catfish.
Hey, for $10 a meal, this is the best deal in town. I
t’s enjoyable and fun if you like to cook.

I was not a fan of this recipe at all. The catfish by itself was wonderful...but the dirty rice and remoulade was really off for me.

I'm from New Orleans, love cajun and creole cuisine...this wasn't it. The rice was bland with way too much green pepper and celery and the relish in the remoulade was overpowering.

I've enjoyed every BA meal I've had (some more than others--but nothing I wouldn't be happy to eat again)....but this recipe was very disappointing.

Overall, pretty tasty. Didn't feel particularly healthy though. Usually if I'm eating something fried, I prefer to have lots of veggies with it. Rice needed 30 min to cook and an extra 1/4 cup of water. Subbed capers for the sweet relish (because EW), and it completely made the dish. If you have some in your fridge, I highly recommend subbing them.

I really liked this one. As others have noted, brown rice always takes a full 40 minutes for me and this was no exception. I just started that early. I did also flour both sides of the fish - I have no idea why the directions would have you flour only one side. My fillets were very large and thick and needed the full 6 minutes to cook. I normally REALLY dislike green bell pepper and celery, so I was surprised by how much I liked the rice. They blended in really well. I did serve sauteed collard greens on the side because I felt like this needed more veggies. I would call the remoulade just a quick tartar sauce, but it was a good accompaniment to the fish, which was VERY good - I'm picky about catfish and mine was excellent, not the least bit fishy.

Excellent dish. As others have said, the rice needed at least 30-45 minutes to cook and needed a lot more water (I think I used 1 1/4 cups by the time it was ready). The sauce was basically just tartar sauce but all together it was delicious.

As has been stated, the cooking time for the rice is totally understated.... mine needed more water and another 20 minutes, easy... and it was still a little too underdone (but the veggies were too OVER done by that time, so I ended the cooking.

Overall, this was my least favorite of my BA meals. It was just totally a bore. I used ALL of the hot sauce and the remoulade was dull. One piece of catfish was not properly fileted, so there was a large strip of skeleton-tendon or whatever down the center that was inedible.

I also coated both sides of the fish... I mean, why not? There was plenty of the flour mix to go around.

This is the first recipe card that went right into the recycle bin... they can't all be winners.

Blue Apron is making me a better chef by forcing me to second-guess the quantities of ingredients in their dishes; the dirty rice would have been perfect with about 1/3 of the bell pepper and 1/4 of the onion provided. As it was, the dish was literally 2/3 vegetable, 1/3 rice; as a result, the veggies absorbed all the water and the rice didn't cook one iota.

The fish itself was perfect, and the remoulade was outstanding. Just, yeah, really need to work on proportion control, at least out of your Texas office.

What I wish I had known: The rice really does take 40 minutes, just like everyone says. Also, I felt like the rice really needed a bit of acid to brighten it up. A squeeze of fresh lemon juice really did the trick. And, why not cover both sides of the fillet with the spice mix? It's so good!

So glad I consulted the Blue Apron Facebook before making this! Thanks to you guys I cooked the rice for 45 minutes (VERY necessary), and decided to use chicken broth instead of water, and I grated half a piece of Aidell's chicken sausage into a fine ground to give the rice some extra flavor. It turned out great! A really warm, hearty, filling meal.

Did anyone else get double the amount of rice and spice mix called for by the recipe? My box had two bags of rice, which I thought was strange, so I measured them out. Sure enough, each bag had 1/2 cup of rice, which is the amount called for on the recipe card. The same was true with the spice mix: I got two bags, each containing a little more than the 1 1/2 tablespoons that the recipe calls for. I'm not complaining—I can always use the extra rice and cajun spices another time—but it was a little confusing.

We loved this dish. My partner is a bit skeptical about fish that he hasn't caught, but he loved the cajun catfish more than any other Blue Apron dish we have made previously. I loved it too. I did have to cook the rice for about 10 minutes. Will definately order the fish dishes in the future!

The rice was not good - overpowered by way too much green pepper. Would have been better with twice as much rice. Fish was good, but sauce was just tarter sauce with a splash of Tabasco. Disappointing overall, except for the fish.

This is the first dish I have seriously not liked. Something about the flavor profile was all off to me. The fish tasted like pine sol, the celery & parsley didn't work & the remoulade was too sweet. I hope to never see this in our box again.

Wow, this was good. I never liked catfish until I tried this dish, but am so glad I decided to give it a try this round. I decided to bread both sides of the fish and am glad I did. I had a great crisp on both sides of both filets. I agree with everyone that the rice needed to be cooked longer and most likely more water added. Be careful not to add too much water, though or you will end up with soupy/soggy rice. In addition to the sweet relish and tabasco, I added some yellow mustard and sriracha to the mayo. I mixed the remoulade in with the rice and thought it was awesome. I don't like parsley so left that out.

I knew brown rice would never cook in that time. my trick with BA is that i use a rice cooker. i start it before i even begin my veggie prep. If it gets done early, the cooker keeps it warm and moist.

The rice tastes great if you mix the remoulade in with it after it's done cooking (...it was really missing a fat), I also finished it off with some lime juice to brighten it up. And the rice took about 35 minutes to cook and I recommend taking the veggies out after they cook up in the beginning and add them again near the end. Also, I coated both sides of the fish... I didn't want to waste the delicious seasoning I'd mix in with the flour :P

I was a little apprehensive of the spice and sweet relish in this recipe (not fond of overly spiced foods, and dislike sweet pickles and relish), but to my surprise, this was a very tasty dish! Granted, I used a little over half the spice called for in the recipe, and maybe two-thirds of the sweet relish. As for the rice, I thought mine cooked just fine in the time allotted. I didn't start the countdown until the water came to a full boil. My catfish fillets were quite generous, so I divided my meals into three portions and saved the leftover for lunch.

I'm surprised at some of the negative comments.., we thought this was an all around great meal. We did not add the celery to the rice (completely unnecessary) and I did have a splash of lime juice to add to the rice. We did only use about 1/2 the sweet relish for the tarter sauce but that's pretty obvious as I was adding it in. I am not a fan of spice but the tobasco sauce gave the tarter sauce a really nice flavor. We thought the "remoulade" aka tarter sauce went really well on the fish, and the rice flour catfish was amazing as usual. We did cook the rice for exactly 35 minutes and it was perfect.

Thanks for the tip on cooking the rice for about 40 minutes. Absolutely necessary and really enjoyed the flavor (probably added more salt/pepper than most). The fish was fantastic. We cut down on the calorie count by cutting the rice portion in half, and not using even close to the amount of remoulade for the fish. It was yum on its own.

Glad I wasn't the only one having an issue with the rice! I kept adding more water and left it on 3 times as long. It still wasn't quite as done as I would have liked. I liked the mix of flavors though. Liked the catfish too. The 'remoulade' was definitely not remoulade! It was more of a tartar. Not a fan at all! Also, my parsley was missing from the box, even though they sent the card all about parsley. lol This was the first time I have been really disappointed with BA.

Wish I would have seen this info about the rice before we cooked the fish. Hoping the Fish does not dry out before the rice is done. I will say that the remoulade sauce is nothing like I have ever seen or tasted in South Louisiana. The dirty rice should have some kind of spiced meat in it to be a true Dirty Rice.

Also very glad to have brown rice as a option. I did the rice first, added a bit more water, let the pot get to a good boil and then put on medium simmer. Checked at 20 minutes and it was dry and perhaps a bit underdone but good. So for next time use maybe 1 1/2 cups of water and maybe 25 minutes on medium simmer. Helps if you have an excellent pot too. Just replaced mine a while ago. Fish I coated both sides and cooked the second side for three minutes. Flakey and good and browned and it was all yummy. Husband not a fan of sweet relish in general but the sauce was nice. Will definitely do again.

Dirty rice is suppose to be made with chicken livers, thats part of the "dirty" part. As far as the Remoulade sauce goes, this is the most lack luster recipe I've ever seen. Mine has at least a dozen ingredients, which means it is pain to make, but taste wise it well worth the effort.
Both Dirty Rice and Remoulade are exquist, but they do have to be made correctly. I will use what ingredients I can, but I'm following my own recipes for the Dirty Rice and Remoulade.

We really enjoyed this meal! I have taken to reading reviews before cooking. This was one recipe I was glad I did. I started the rice early, and used vegetable broth instead of water, and cooked it for about 20 to 25 minutes. While this was cooking I put the celery bell pepper onion with a bit of the spice mix in a frypan with olive oil and cook that. I then added the vegetable mixture to the rice and continue cooking for about 10 more minutes. This worked out great, and the rice was cooked perfectly. I have also learned to taste test all spice packets before use, As we don't care for spicy foods, and used very little of the spice blend. I also coated both sides of the fish with the rice flour. There was more than enough food with this recipe that we will actually have another meal of it.

The preparation of this dish took me approximately 55 minutes (getting closer to Blue Apron's estimate, but still slow), but the dish was yummy! The rice could stand to cook a little longer (I had it on 20ish minutes in a wide pot with a big burner, so it should have heated quicker, I thought) and the remoulade was FANTASTIC! I was nervous to try catfish because of my pre-conceived notions in its regard, but it turned out to be a rather mild fish and the spices and other flavors blended very well to give it some "umph"! If you are a fish fan, I definitely recommend trying this!

I ended up adding about another 1/2 cup of water to my rice and cooking for an additional 10-15 minutes. I'm not sure why BA thinks brown rice can be cooked in 20 minutes. Unless you like your rice crunchy, you will need to cook it longer.

You also won't nee the entire onion, pepper, celery for this dish. I ended up chopping all of mine, cooking them, put taking out about half before adding the rice. I've saved them in my freezer for a small batch of soup later on.

I made some modifications - including adding a vegetable to this dish - and as modified it was good. Not great, but tasty.

I don't see fish and a starch being a meal - you need vegetables. I made some orange glazed purple carrots, but almost anything would work with this.

The big change for the dirty rice was to cook everything in bacon fat to give it some meaty flavor (I think some spicy sausage would have worked but I didn't have any on hand). I also added an Anaheim (mildly spicy) pepper and used only half of the provided green bell pepper. That gave me a very tasty, spicy rice. Based on ...See More

Every so often a spice mix shows up from Blue Apron that smells and tastes overwhelmingly musty/moldy to my Husband and I. . .This was one of them. After going back over other recipes we've encountered this in. . .I can see the common denominator is the Dried Thyme. I was glad that I only used a tiny bit in the rice (wish I hadn't used any) and none on the fish but I added lots of Frank's Red Hot sauce to it to compensate. I also substituted Frank's Red Hot for the Tabasco in the remoulade. I prefer the flavor and the heat isn't overpowering

I didn't like this. It wasn't horrible but it was not great. The rice really needs tweaking. I did add more water and cook it longer but it was still not tasty following the BA directions on this recipe. I'm also not that fond of catfish I realize. The fish itself has no flavor to me--or maybe the spicyness of this dish overpowered it. I agree about there being no vegetables. A salad or something else needs to round out this dish.

This was a winner. The catfish was just as fresh and sweet as could be (I froze it right out of the box as I needed to hold this recipe for a few days.) It cooked up beautifully and we really enjoyed it. Plan a solid 30 minutes or more for the brown rice to cook. The directions will work for white rice, but are wrong for brown rice which needs more time. It just does. Once finished, the dirty rice was just a little bland for our tastes (and I added garlic!) but we enjoyed it anyway, and I'll know what to do next time to spice it up (use a bit of the spice blend I use in jambolaya.) The remoulade was SO much better than bottled tartar sauce! This recipe is a keeper.
