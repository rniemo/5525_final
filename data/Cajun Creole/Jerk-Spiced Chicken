Janice, its meant to be two servings! If you want more you have to order for the numbeof people in your family. I have two people and this recipe is more than enough for us to have dinner and some left over! Good deal.

We live the SF Bay Area and eat Mexican, Thai, Indian, and Szechuan food. However, the jerk chicken was way beyond hot. It burned our mouths and was an unpleasant dining experience. Someone obviously overdid the cayenne pepper. Too bad!

This was even a bit spicy, I wish there had been a warning of some sort.

I agree, it was really spicy, a little too hot. A note on the packaging or less pepper would be great.

Not sure if it's a matter of taste or if there was variability in the jerk seasoning, but we fixed the jerk chicken and beans last night, used the entire packet of jerk seasoning, and found it pleasantly spicy (with a complex taste, not overpowering at all.) The rice definitely offset the spice a bit, but it was much less hot than most "jerk" dishes I've had in the past. . .. We actually voted this one a winner to make again!

The spice was just right for me and my girlfriend, but we do like spicy foods. I could see how it is a bit much for people who don't prefer spicy foods. I would defiantly make this again.

I really want to like this dish more -- even got me to eat a green pepper -- but it was way too spicy for me. When I could taste everything before the spice kicked in, it was great. If i were to do this again, I'd use much less of the jerk seasoning.

We thought it was delicious, but we also found that it was lacking in spice. Next time we'll add a jalape√±o or two because we didn't taste any of the spice.
