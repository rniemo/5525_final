OOoh! first time working with Okra! Super exciting. If it's as good as your Shrimp Etoufee, I'll be in love! :)

I am not a fan of okra. ( it's too slimy for me) I do live gumbo though is there any other veggies you could recommend to add?

The okra is what makes gumbo, gumbo. Everything else is optional. Really...that's what the word "gumbo" means. When it's cooked down in the mix, the slimy-ness turns more into a thickening agent for the pot so you shouldn't really encounter any of that texture once the dish is finished. The okra should be somewhat hollow at that point or even broken into strips of the outer parts. If it's not, you haven't cooked it long enough.

Not a fan of celery...or green bell pepper...or okra, BUT, Blue Apron, I wasn't a fan of peanut sauce, either, until last week's Chicken Sate.

The week before, the braised Romano beans were a revelation...so you are teaching me to keep an open mind and embrace a "festival of flavors" (phrase coined by my hubby). Looking forward to making Gumbo and surprising my hubs. :-)

Are any of your ingredients Organic? I usually buy organic. Also, is there a place where you can specify allergies? Example, I am allergic to Bell Pepper. I, of course would omit the bell pepper, but it seems it is a waste of food. I also can not eat seeds, such as fennel, poppy or flax.

How spicy is this? I'm have a very low tolerance for spicy foods (even more so when I'm pregnant.) I wish you guys had a way to mark preferences for spicy foods.

I am a bit of a gumbo aficionado, so I look forward to your recipe with RELISH! (That said... tomatoes? really? you can't exactly grow those in the swamp - and if it's not swamp-friendly, it ain't Cajun!)

Gumbo not. Roux with butter instead of oil? Tomatoey. Bland. This was a fail in my book.

Did anyone else's pot of gumbo pop tomato sauce everywhere? Even on low? I ended up covering the pot with foil to make the pot stop spewing.

First I want to start off by saying I LOVE BLUE APRON. Now, I have 1 suggestion... when you send out ingredients, such as Canned Tomatoes, is there a way for you to purchase and send BPA free cans of food? I will be going to the store and purchasing Canned tomatoes that are in a BPA free can and not using the kind you sent (no offense, :) ) I am excited to try this recipe tonight, but this would be my only suggestion. Again, love you guys!

Could this all go in a crock pot for 6 hours to cook? Shredded chicken that way is just so good.

How is everyone already making the gumbo? I'm supposed to receive this recipe in my shipment tomorrow.

Eh... okay guys. This one was a miss. Not sure what that was, but it wasn't gumbo. All that tomato kills the nuttiness of the roux. And MAN that was a tomato-y thing. Also, that was completely the wrong kind of sausage. You need to use a SMOKED sausage of some kind - preferably an andouille or a kielbasa. That fennel-rich sausage we received was very strange.

If I may, I would like to offer your chefs MY gumbo recipe. Give this a whirl: it will change your life. http://bit.ly/marksgumbo

I really didn't care for this. The canned tomatoes tasted just like that; canned tomatoes.

I was so excited for this recipe and it was such a disappointment, agree with most of the comments, tomatoe-y and bland... no flavor...should of used a different type of sausage. also was too spicy... the pot boils and the sauce pops everywhere so be careful, I have burns from stirring and now a bubble on my finger! ;(

I loved this, but it's crazy that the recipes calls this two servings! This made roughly FIVE portions. So much food!

This was not a great recipe. Too much tomato, which masked many of the other flavors. Could have used more seasoning as well, though with a better balance of flavors, it may be enough.

Very tasty - not very spicy (and I am a spice wimp.) Was perfect serving size for 2 - hubby even got seconds. Mine didn't "pop" - wonder if its because I cook on a gas stove rather then electric? Was a great first week - can't wait for next week!

We absolutely loved this and will be re-using this recipe as the weather turns colder. Next time we plan to add a little more rice, a little more spice, and serve in bread bowls. Thanks Blue Apron!

I made this for dinner last night and it was great! Very easy to follow. The portions for me were closer to four people instead of two (or maybe two VERY hungry dude portions). I'm having leftovers for lunch today!

Absolutely love the service, but guys... This one was bad :/

I honestly think if I had just omitted the GIANT can of crushed tomatoes and just let the whole thing simmer in water, it would have tasted a lot better. As it was, this tasted like ketchup soup.

Come to think of it, of all the Blue Apron recipes I have done, the only ones I can say I actively disliked (and that is under 5) involved these canned tomatoes. I think in the future when I see them involved in a recipe, I am just going to skip.

Blue apron - would recommend sending a smaller can of condensed tomato sauce next time. The HUGE can you sent was too watery hence the sauce was too thin. I had to add extra rice to thicken it further. Also, need a lot more seasoning. As is, the recipe was too bland. I had to add additional seasonings.

I had read the prior reviews and cut tomatoes by 1/3 and still ended up with a thick, bland tomato dish. This did not seem like gumbo to me at all ... Tomorrow morning, I'll try and salvage since I do not like wasting food.

Good but there was just something missing in the spices. Andouille sausage would have added a truer Cajun flavor. I also think this could have used more rice and less tomato. The tomato was almost overwhelming in this recipe. Hubby liked it though, and this easily made 4 servings.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe as is. For one thing, I think it's worth making the rice with chicken stock separately rather than including in the gumbo pot. This is the second Blue Apron tomato-sauce based meal that's been underwhelming for me. (The first was a spaghetti sauce.) In general I think spices are under-represented in BA's tomato-based recipes. I even added a few drops of hot sauce to the original recipe of this gumbo but still wasn't terribly impressed.

The second serving was better a few days later but I also tweaked the recipe quite a bit. I made additional rice separately (...See More

I use a combo of this and a smothered okra and tomatoes recipe to wonderful results. Basically, I cook down the trinity and okra, add stewed tomatoes, and slow cook in the crock pot for 3 hours, adding Chachere's near the end. From there, I make the roux (the darker the better, I've spent 30 minutes on a good roux before!) and add to the mix. I sub chicken thighs instead of breasts and throw the sliced chicken and sausage over the skillet for a little sear before adding to the mix. I don't add the rice to the mix, but serve it over rice. Delicious and makes the house smell wonderful, and goes nicely with red beans and rice and some cornbread.

Also, when I make this and red beans and rice, I've found it to be well worth it to prep the veggies and meats the day before so everything's ready to add while cooking. There's a lot involved so nice to break into steps. Also, chopped onion, celery, and bell pepper all freeze well for use in these recipes.

The color the show throws me off and tells me they don't have an authentic cajun making the cajun recipes. Gumbo supposed to be more of a light brown, like muddy bayou water. Not red, this recipe doesn't cook the roux enough.
