I love BA but the lack of upfront disclose on where the seafood is coming from on the website menu and on packaging itself is troubling. I think most of subscribers assume that the seafood is wild or in the case of shell fish from the most reputable, regulated and environmentally friendly farms. I would encourage BA to adopt policies that ensure that only the healthiest seafood is used in the case of farmed food this means domestic or canadian farms "over the past 50 years, anywhere from 5 to 80 percent of the mangrove forests in Thailand, Ecuador, Indonesia, China, Mexico, and Vietnam (the five leading shrimp-farming countries) have been destroyed to make room for more coastal shrimp farms."

I share the concern about seafood and meat sourcing. I would never knowingly buy farmed shrimp from Southeast Asia so please let us know that in the future. That said - this was a very tasty dish, after doubling the quantity of cheese, scallions and garlic, and adding about a teaspoon and a half of Old Bay seasoning to the shrimp as it cooked (and cooking them for about half the recommended time; otherwise shrimp that tiny would have been overdone and tough). I will definitely re-use this recipe, with wild-caught Gulf shrimp, and add a little bacon as another cook suggested.

I should preface this by saying that I'm from Boston, and my family is from Boston. So I don't know if my opinions on shrimp and grits should be trusted. :) This was really good. But I like my grits thick. Like breakfast porridge, or like cream-of-wheat. So I had to cook the grits for a WHILE. I turned the heat off on the pan of veggies while I waited for the grits. It took a while. But it was worth the wait. And, yes, this is not "light" food. :) So split it into 3 servings, maybe. Or eat salads for the rest of the week. But it's yummy....cheesey, buttery goodness.

Just made this last night and it was delicious. I have never had shrimp and grits before though, so I could be biased. I just got a "tips" email that reccommends boiling your grits in 3 cups of water to start for thicker grits and then adding 3/4 cup of water if you wanted a thinner cosistancy. The recipe card just said to boil 3 3/4 cups so I ended up with a more watery grit even after cooking for a longer amount of time, but it was still really good. I would use less water next time.

Do not use the lemon zest in grits. Grits are supposed to taste like corn. The lemon zest makes them taste like a lemon pudding. The grits were great before I added the zest. I did not add early in the cooking. Also not so much water. Grits should be thicker. Shrimp were fabulous.

Holy moly, I think this is the best shrimp and grits I've ever had! At least in the top 5. I'm a transplanted Yankee, been here in NC since 1978, and have come to love this dish. If it's on the menu, I will order it! One tip I followed was to put the fresh corn in at the end. Careful with the salt; taste as you go. The lemon was a fabulous addition; not something I've had before. I used the recommended amount of water and cooked until the consistency was right. It took a few more minutes, but turned out perfectly. For calorie counters, save the extra grits and have grits cakes pan sautéed with an egg or two. Thumbs way up on this one!

I thought this recipe worked well. All the ingredients were fresh and cooked just right. I started with only 3 cups of water for the grits, but eventually needed the entire 3 ¾ cups to achieve correct consistently. The butter helped with both the grits and shrimp mixture.

we loved this dish had never ate grits before, I also used the extra water. People DO not use the salt and pepper in every recipe that blue apron has listed. No one needs that much salt and too much pepper can ruin a dish. other wise we have been loving our blue apron meals for 4 months now!

Awww, man, this is great. Just great.

Yeah, watch out for the mistake on the card. Start with 3 cups of water, not 3 3/4, and have more on hand. I ended up adding 1/4 cup more.

Also, and I say this often, you need more time than the card says. Grits take at least 15 minutes; they will tell you when they are done (if you know grits, you know what I mean). The zucchini needs more time than what is indicated here, don't rush it. I gave it 4-5 minutes before adding the tomatoes, scallions, butter, lemon juice, and shrimp, in that order. I made the shrimp a little less done in the initial step to guard against overcooking in Step 5, which worked out well.

One more thing on the grits: You need to STIR them, a lot; and don't leave them unstirred for more than, say 30 seconds. For people whose came out clumped together, that is why. Glide them in them across the surface of the pot rather than dumping all in at once; that will help a bit in preventing clumping initially.

i made our first Blue Apron meal last night, The southern-style Shrimp & grits. i've never made grits before but after reading the reviews on this dish i followed some tips for less water & longer cook time and it turned out perfect. my husband was skeptical because the package arrived at 5 and we didn't make it home until 10 that night and he thought some items might be spoiled. i just put everything in the refrigerator and made it the next day. i asked him if he like it and he said it was ok as he finished everything on his plate (this made enough for 4 people, there were so many shrimp and not tiny ones). the prep time says 15 min and cook time 15-25 min...it took me a lot longer to prep, thank goodness it only took 20 min to cook. (wish i was faster at the prep work). i would make this again with or without the grits. maybe with pasta or rice next time. so many options! i'm glad we are trying Blue Apron and can't wait to make the next dish tonight, Taiwanese Three Cup Chicken :)

This was an excellent dish and the portion size is on the higher side for BA! To make the Grits less bland, I think using more lemon zest than recommended (Like 4 teaspoons or so), and a lot of pepper can bring out the flavor.

The paprika shrimp was great, I again used a lot of pepper and a bit of salt when mixing, and the flavor turned out great.

Ok, I come fromt he state that gave shrimp and grtis to the world, and I'll tell you what, this was really good! I did tweak the grits a bit: I like to cook them in half chicken broth and half milk for a creamier texture and improved flavor. Regular stone ground grits are better but take much longer to cook, so I get why Blue Apron used the quicker cooking grits.

At any rate, this was as delicious as any shrimp and grits I've ever had.

This recipe really could serve 3 people with some crusty bread on the side. In fact, most of the BA meals that do not contain 2 distinct pieces (chicken breasts, fish, etc.) could be spread out for 3-4 people, especially anything with meatballs.

Wish I had seen the comments about less water. I thought it seemed like a lot. We're currently eating grits soup. I would have liked a little heat for the shrimp mix but over all a nice recipe. Just needs some tweaking.

This was my first Blue Apron meal. My husband and I loved it (gave it 5 of 5 stars) even though my husband is not a big shrimp eater. I enjoyed the variety of textures - zucchini, shrimp, corn, cherry tomato, scallions, cheese grits and how colorful the food looked. The zucchini, corn, tomato, and scallions were so fresh and beautiful - no bruises or brown spots. Tips: You will also need olive oil and a cheese grater for this recipe. It came with butter and paprika. I have the small glass prep bowls, and it made assembling the various ingredients easier. I lined them up in rows based on what group of ingredients I needed to add next. Although I added a big clove of garlic, next time, I may add two to add more flavor since I do not use as much salt. The 2 tsp of lemon zest gave a nice, subtle lemon flavor to the grits.

I have made shrimp and grits for a couple of years but I learned a couple of things with this one. This is a lower cal version than I usually do but we liked it a LOT. I actually used 1 cup of chicken broth with 2 cups of water when I started the grits. I ended up using another 1/2 cup or so of water and the grits were perfect. I would have tried some milk as a couple of others suggested, but didn't have enough on hand without shorting the hub's breakfast supply. I'll do that next time. I usually use stone ground grits, but these worked just fine and were very tasty and creamy.

We really liked this meal. Next time I will hold back some of the lemon and reduce the amount of water used to cook the grits.

This would have been great, but as others have mentioned, the recipe called for WAY too much water in the grits. They turned out so soupy, cooking them longer didn't seem to help at all.

Pretty disappointed in Blue Apron, the recipes should be bulletproof! You shouldn't have to come check the comments here first to see if you need to make tweaks to the recipe! Considering the large number of people that had problems, it seems BA needs to do some more thorough recipe testing.

Very disappointed that this receipebox did not come with any olive oil for cooking the vegitables and the shrimp as instructed. And of course, I did not have any in the kitchen. Instead, I used butter I had on hand, and I'm sure as a result the caloric intake went through the roof.

Loved the shrimp! Had it with rice as we are not grits lovers. It was awesome with rice.

Whoa. This was absolutely delicious! I used about 4 cloves of garlic in total and sauteed 2 cloves in olive oil with the lemon zest and salt before adding the water, grits and corn. I also used about 2/3 of the butter in the grits. I added extra cherry tomatoes and Old Bay seasoning to the shrimp. This may be my top meal so far!

Made the Burgers last night. I found the olive mayo a little light and watery. I should have chopped the olives more. It said ruff cut. The shallot vinaigrette didn't seem to look right. Maybe should have chopped them smaller or I added to much mustard. The good news is everything was delicious. I love cooking with BA. I work 12 hour days and enjoy coming home to have all the ingredients waiting for me. The prep work unwinds me from my day and the meals have been great. I can see that I'm going to expand my cooking to include these techniques with other dishes over time. Can't wait for the fall dishes.

This was really good, but the portions were huge. Instead of two servings, this made 4 for me, and I'm not a particularly light eater. I didn't have the problem of too much liquid in the grits like some people reported--it does take a while for it all to come together and get creamy, though. I left out the tomato and it was still delicious. I'm allergic and can't wait for them to be out of season, but the corn has been more than welcome!

The shrimp was great, but I did not like the grits at all. Bland, not much flavor. I'd make the shrimp again, but ate it with brown rice instead.

Not a big grits fan, not being from the South; but the lemon zest did add a nice freshness, and the fresh corn, texture. All in all, I could have done without the grits. Shrimp was good, but not outstanding. I live in the Northwest were we have tons of fresh seafood and prefer my seafood very simply prepared, so that I can enjoy the flavor of it. I did not have any problem with cooking the grits with 3 3/4 cups water. They came out perfectly creamy, but you do have cook them a long time to get the water to evaporate. If the shrimp would have come with the shells on, I would have made a simple shrimp stock to use instead of plain water.

This was an amazing taste. You do have to watch your grits, to make sure they don't cook out too quickly....the combination of flavors was excellent.

Both my husband and I loved this meal. The grits were creamy and flavorful. Served it with a fresh garden salad. Blue Apron has renewed my love for cooking.

I made this without the grits. I cooked the corn in the skillet with 1 tsp of olive oil after cooking and removing the zucchini. I added back the cooked ingredients following the rest of the recipe and added the lemon zest as well. Delicious and less calories.

Wasn't what I expected hoped to have a shrimp flavor but there was none, only the lemon it was not a favorite.
The grits was delicious wish we could have seafood that have a seafood taste, I am from Louisiana and the shrimp has no flavor at all must be farm raised.

This was ok. The shrimp was the best part. The rest tasted kind of bland. I might not have used enough salt.

I cannot believe how good this was. I will definitely be making this again. We used lemon olive oil to cook the veggies in for an exra lemon kick. I did find that when we reheated the leftovers the grits were much more smooth (added a bit of water), but still one of the best BA meals we've had.

This was my first grits creation, and it was delicious! It came with lots of big shrimp and we so much enjoyed eating in for a dish we would have to go to the south to eat. The only thing I would change is to make the shrimp a little more spicier by adding pepper flakes.

Skipped the grits since it's not my thing and my husband is lactose intolerant. Added the corn to the shrimp dish and we had it over brown rice. Very tasty.

I enjoyed this dish. However, after I made it the first night I had a rip-roaring headache the next morning...strange. Then, I had it for lunch 2 nights later and woke up the next morning with a headache. Very strange. I didn't have wine with the meal and drink plenty of water.

It was sad because I liked the dish and the dance of flavor with the lemon in grits. Oh well.

This is our all time BA favorite. Hubs was skeptical about grits as he grew up in the south and never liked them - he has been asking me to make it ever since.
