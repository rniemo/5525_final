3 OF 5 STARS. Loved the sweet potatoes. Catfish was okay. Buns were "pedestrian white bread" -- and I am not a fan. And the sauce? Well, you kind of fixate on mayo & grain-mustard. Eh, I can do without mayo & grain-mustard only needs a dash.

This was excellent. I cut my sweet potatoes a little thinner than the picture and it was very enjoyable. I loved the Dijon mustard.

This was so good. Sandwiches were to big. Would have preferred smaller sandwiches with another side.

Delicious! Catfish fried up beautifully, bread was good. Sweet potatoes were a nice side dish. The only thing I would have done differently is less dijon in the remoulade. Blue Apron's dijon is very pungent and can be a bit overpowering, in my opinion.
