My notes:
* Make sure your roux cooks to a dark peanut butter color
* Add a bay leaf to peppers/onion/garlic
* Sub chicken broth for water (or bouillon cubes)
* If you use the whole spice packet it's (good) spicy. We loved it but if you don't like spicy then use 1/2 or 3/4 of the packet
* I think the shrimp in a separate pan is unnecessary - if I made it again I'd season and throw them in for the last 5 mins of rice cooking time

This meal was very good! I made a few small adjustments. The main one being that when I sautéed the shrimp, I added fresh garlic and some of the Cajun spice. I also added the spices to the veggies and let them sauté a bit before adding the liquid, this gives the spices a chance to bloom.

We aren't big fans of spicy heat, so we added only 1/2 tsp of the spice packet (1/3 of the provided packet), then added another tsp of combined smoked paprika, onion powder, oregano, and thyme. The dish was delicious and flavorful.

I'm not a big fan of rice dishes but this one was excellent. We had a friend over who was skeptical of the Blue Apron process and she watched us go through all the steps and thoroughly enjoyed it -- AND the meal. Again, excellent leftovers. We thought the shrimp was remarkably fresh.

Very interesting recipe and good flavors however I wish I had used only 1/2 the spice pack. We are good with heat and would probably catagorize this as "Medium" using the whole packet, but the heat wasn't the issue, it was more that using the whole packet overpowered the flavors making it hard to enjoy the more subtle flavors like the honey, and the buttery roux. If it made it again I would cut the spice in half so the other flavors could stand out more.

Loved this recipe, but wish the shrimp had come completely deveined. I didn't realize half of them (at least) would need to be deveined and it threw off my cooking time. Other than that, it was delicious.

I didn't think that the shrimp was good ... it was "shiny" and chewy and the dish took time to prepare which would've been fine had I not added the entire packet of seasoning which totally ruined it. The only flavor was that of the seasoning which was smoke flavored. : / Not a fan on this one.

I think they switched out yellow tomatoes for Italian red ones. Anyone else notice that? I don't think I'll use them for this. Italian seasoned tomatoes with Cajun seasoning doesn't sound like it would fit together.

Unfortunately, we found this to be our least favorite BA meal after the last 2 months of meals. It really lacked the right flavor to compare to authentic etouffee. The quark and honey? not sure where BA came up with the recipe for etouffee with these two ingredients. A miss in my book.

We tried doing this without adding the salt, but it was a little bland. Amazing what just a small pinch of salt did for this dish.

Thanks for the helpful comments. We checked our shrimp carefully and about a 1/3 still needed to be deveined. The dish was very good and not all that spicy (used the full spice pack). The quark was missing from our box, so we substituted 2T of sour cream and it worked fine.

Shrimp stock instead of water would make this out of this world. Will be saving this recipe and searching for whole shrimp for next time

My family liked this recipe. We like our food a bit spicier though. I used the entire spice packet and then added two teaspons of tobasco to give it some kick.

I love blue apron, but does anyone fine that almost every recipe takes twice as long to cook as they say?

This is only our second week on the plan and this is without a doubt the best recipe so far.

this was a great recipe! Can anyone please suggest some proportions for replicating the spice package? I would like to make this again.

This recipe was absolutely delicious however i added a big bunch of fresh spinach at the end to add some bulk to the dish. After a 16 hour day I could've eaten to whole pot myself. I know it says it feeds a family of 4 but 4 of what size people. Anyway definitely with it .

Loved the flavors. Unfortunately, the creme fraiche was squooshed. The cup broke and smeared all over some of the other ingredients. I had some marscapone at home so I added that instead. It worked fine. I was able to salvage the other ingredients.
