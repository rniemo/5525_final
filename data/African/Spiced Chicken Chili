I absolutely loved this! It's incredibly filling so my husband and I both have lunch for tomorrow also. Best part for me was that the chicken was sent already cut up. I hate handling chicken, so this made this meal even more of a pleasure.

I was a little concerned that the sweet potato wasn't even slightly softened when fried to the suggested time with the onion but after cooking with the other ingredients it was completely done.

My toaster oven handled making the pita using the toaster setting. It came out perfectly. I hope this helpsâ€¦ Enjoy!

Hands down, one of the best BA dishes I've had in a long time. Made exactly as listed, except I kept the liquid from the chickpeas and used that plus regular water to make the 2 cups of water added to the pan. Also, I did not rinse the chickpeas. 5 stars !!!!

This was a perfect dish for a busy sports weeknight because it adapts really well to a slow cooker. I drained the chickpeas and reserved the liquor, put the chicken, chickpeas, currants and diced sweet potato in the crock pot (adding some salt), sauteed the onion and garlic in a skillet with some olive oil and salt and pepper, added the tomato paste and spice blend to the skillet and sauteed a bit, then added 1.5 cups of liquid using the chickpea liquor and enough water to make 1.5 cups (since it wouldn't evaporate much in the slow cooker) and let that simmer for a minute to fully develope the flour in the spice mixture. I then poured that into the crock pot, stirred and cooked for 8 hours on low. I added the lemon juice just before serving and toasted the pitas and it was very, very good. You do have to watch the salt if you use the chickpea liquor because it's salty but it gives the chili a nice body, even in the slow cooker.

I don't like chili or stews at all, and I really wish I could have substituted this for one of the vegetarian options. I definitely didn't like it, but not because it's a bad recipe. Just forced to get something I don't like since the other two recipes looked delicious. Anyway this is more of a Indian curry stew, not a chili. It was fairly spicy, and had a very strong curry flavor. The pitas were delicious and would have been burnt if cooked the whole time suggested. It also got a little dry, so I added a little bit of extra water with the lemon juice at the end,

I do not like the taste combination of chicken with tomato sauce. Any ideas for replacing the tomato paste with some other type of paste that would work in this dish? (I wish we could substitute the chicken dishes with a vegetarian dish as easily as we can the fish dish.)

This dish was absolutely AMAZING!!! The combinations sometimes seem a bit off, but work well in the end. Blue Apron has not disappointed me yet. Even the recipes I think I won't like, I end up loving. So glad a friend introduced me to BA. My fiancee and I enjoy preparing the meals together as well. Prep time always seems way off, but maybe that's just my culinary skills, or lack thereof. :-)

I think I made a mistake with the sweet potato. I should have chopped it smaller than medium dice. I found that they didn't cook through and didn't absorb any of the flavor of the sauce. I would have enjoyed this dish more with more evenly cut potatoes. I thought the flavor was great. and enjoyed the combination of seasoning, chicken and chick peas. Plus I thought the addition of the lemon and currants added an interesting twist.

This was fabulous!! Very flavorful and one of the few meals that there was enough for 2 with leftovers. A couple of things I did; 1. Instead of adding plain water, added chicken broth. 2. It took considerably longer than 10 minutes to reduce. More like 15-20 minutes. 3. Cooked the pita for 5 minutes @ 425 convect -- perfect! This is one of my favorites to date.

This dish was really quite good! I did make one major change, since I quite like pita bread and didn't feel the need to bake it to a crisp. I lowered the temperature to 350 for 5-7 minutess. The result was a nice warm pita with a pleasant crunch on the edges that was still soft inside.

I thought this recipe yielded a lot of food, and I have at least one full serving left over...I'm going to see if the leftovers are better. I didn't enjoy this recipe, in fact I thought it was one of my least favorites. I did appreciate the fact that the chicken came pre-cut, but the recipe itself just didn't turn out that great. I followed the cooking time and temp instructions, but for some reason the sweet potatoes were barely cooked. Also, the chickpeas, while I do like them, didn't seem to make sense in this recipe. Overall, it was a lot of "raw" textures that I tried to appreciate, but just didn't "wow" me. Maybe next week will be better!

This is the very first meal from Blue Apron, I made. A little too much cardamom for me in the spice mix. I'm hoping it will mellow overnight, for my lunch tomorrow. Very generous portion. I will be getting four meals out of it. Which is great.
To make it easier to dice the sweet potato, I microwaved large chunks of it for about 2 minutes, and then diced them. Otherwise, I do not have the muscle strength to dice them when they are completely raw. Will have to adjust the cooking time in the pan to compensate for the microwave time.

I've been using Blue Apron for about 3 weeks now and I'm in love!!! The Recipes are so easy to follow and I get to try things I've never had before :) This Recipe is my Favorite so far. I was concered about the sweet potatoes not being soft enough but they were perfect. I didnt cook the pita bread like they said to though cause I made this meal before i left for for and I was running late so I just put some of the food in my to go bowl and grabed the pita bread and went to work. It was still good without being toasted. Im glad I found this page cause I was wondering what was in the spice blend so I can make this again lol

This was my second BA meal, and it cooked up much more quickly with less steps than the catfish dish. My husband and I are picky eaters, but we are trying BA to eat a little more "adventurously" to get out of our food rut. I have to say, this is different than anything I would have picked from a recipe and cooked myself.
We liked the heat of this dish, and I loved the combination of the chicken, chickpeas, sweet potato, and onion...however, the spice combination seemed just a little to sweet, a little too much coriander and cardomom. I think that the lemon, orange peel, and currants give it plenty of sweetness - what we would have liked is more heat.
If I do get this in the future, I would probably add cayenne or curry mix to the dish.
Other than that, it was very easy to cook up, and very filling. I also hadn't considered toasting pitas in the oven with salt and pepper before - made them very crispy and tasty.
Looking forward to the next BA night!

We made minor changes with this recipe. Chicken broth instead of water for sure. I also added a little white rice to the bottom of the bowls to make the meal go a little farther. Now I have lunch for work tomorrow. I read about the spice level and added a little sour cream once it was done and it came out creamy and delicious. & a little cilantro to the top.

Our pita got crouton like in the oven so we cut it up and added to the top. A nice crunch in the mix.

Overall, a nice dish for a cold rainy night.

I made this in the crock pot with all the spice, and it is tasty. It isn't hot at all. I'm pleased. Toasted the pita in my toaster (without oil, salt & pepper), and it was fine. Garnished with sour cream. I'm saving the lemon for a separate veggie dish or whatever. It does make a lot of stew; I'm on my second bowl and there's a whole 'nother 2 servings in the fridge.

Hi, does anyone know if there is a way to look at nutrition information before purchasing meals? This one caused a diabetic explosion for my husband, with 109 carbohydrates per serving. I don't expect Blue Apron to change anything just for us, I just want to be able to select meals that are lower in carbohydrates. I did try to give him more chicken and less of everything else, but his blood sugar still skyrocketed after this. He is diabetic, but we love the meals.

BA has really opened my eyes to new flavor combinations. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this recipe. I did cook the chili an extra 5-6 minutes to soften the sweet potato. Next time, I'll have chicken stock/broth on hand instead of using water.

My wine pairing suggestion--Malvasia Bianca.

I don't really know why this is listed as a "chili", the spices are much more for a curry. Anyway, very tasty, I added 1/4 c plain greek yogurt at the end to make it a creamy curry. I would have replaced the water with chicken stock but I was out.

It's disappointing that Blue Apron doesn't include the spice blend proportions any more on the recipe card. What's the point of providing a reusable recipe card if you can't use it to replicate the recipe?

So good! Enough for 3 people. We served it with plain Greek yogurt to swirl in and that was wonderful so thank you for those who suggested it. I reserved a small bit of minced garlic and combined that with olive oil, salt & pepper and used that on the pita chips. Made them in a toaster oven and I agree they should be watched to prevent over browning. All in all, a great winter dinner.

A little late with my comments I know, but I did want to say that this recipe, and recipes like it, are the reason I love Blue Apron. I looked at this recipe on the paper and thought I would HATE it... couldn't have been more wrong. I LOVED this. My family loved this. I will definitely make this again (if I can figure out the spices - 9 parts this? 1 part that? seriously? couldn't give us spoon sizes?). I really enjoy when I make something I think will be weird and end up loving it. Very complex yet not difficult to make, very entertaining to the tongue.

i enjoyed this - but it cried out for heat, for us. i added a healthy amount of cayenne and it was just great. also, though I diced the sweet potato pretty fine, it was still underdone at the end of the cooking time in the recipe. since it seemed like a stew anyway, i thought extra time wouldn't hurt it anyway - and the potato needed it. one thing and another distacted me, and it stewed a long, long time - some of the sweet potato had dissolved into the sauce - which worked out great. it was lovely.

I normally don't do chicken chilis, but this was a really great shot! I really enjoyed the flavors, and I didn't think to reserve the chickpea water, but it was still tasty!

Toasting at 450 for 7 minutes was perfect. I suggest those of you who think oven times are too long check the temperature of the oven. I put in a russet potato because I am tired of sweet potatoes ruining the flavors. I didn't drain the chick peas. Turned out great.

Helpful tip- cut up the pita bread into bit size pieces and briefly cook them in a little olive oil in the pan before you Brown the chicken. There was an old BA recipe like this that uses pita croutons. I also mixed a little plain Greek yogurt with a little lemon juice, mint and cilantro as a garnish. Yum!!

I prepared this meal last night and my wife and I really enjoyed it.
I'm new to this, past I was a meat and potato kinda guy. Yes, my knuckles drag when I walk.

This menu provided 3-4 servings. Wife and I are not big eaters but I'm 6.2 and 200+ and this would have still easily provide 3 servings.

It was a little spicy, we like our food a little on the mild side, this would have been an easy fix.

I didn't dice the sweet potato small enough, so it took longer to cook. But again, my issue and easy fix.

Would have liked to have received 2 pitas, wife loved them (it). :-)...See More
