This turned out perfectly and as always I love how relatively quick it is to prepare a meal. We're always eating in less than an hour. My tips are...instead of crushing the grains of paradise with the bottom of a pot, I use a rolling pin. Works well for crushing the peanuts, too. Much quicker! I often find the limes and lemons are a bit tough to squeeze, not producing much juice. Nuke them for 20-30 seconds first and the juice will squeeze out easily.

YUM! I haven't been able to order BA in quite some time and this was my first meal in a long time and wow, great! Tips: the plantains dry up pretty quick, I'd recommend doing those last. I added some coconut milk and rewarmed to soften. Cook collards longer, keep adding water to soften. The grains of paradise are wonderful! Don't overcook steak. Good cut but thin. Bravo!

What a great service! My husband is working out of town so I am cooking for one now. I just got my first week and all the meals were great. Bursting with new flavor and not a lot of work to prepare. I will make the recipes for friends. Since the delivery is for 2, I cook the meal and then take the second portion to work for a fabulous lunch!

Cooked this last night and really liked it. Based on the reviews, I added milk and butter to the plantain. The steak was flavorful and tender. We are not fond of plantain on its own but with the greens it was good.

This meal was truly delicious. I really wanted more of the plantain mash! I'm holding on to that recipe to use when I plan Caribbean meals as it was delicious. I was a little bit disappointed in the steak. We received a rib eye steak insteak of the sirloin called for in the recipe. While ribeye is delicious and tender, it was really to rich and fatty for this dish with all of the other flavors going on and was too think for the cooking times recommended in the recipie. I used a mortar and pestal for crushing the grains of paradise and that worked well for me. With all of the lemons and limes that I've been zesting with Blue Apron, I strongly reccomend investing in a mocroplane. You get beautiful, airy shreads of zest and never have to cut into the white pith.

This was a really interesting menu. The prospect of steak and something I've never cooked, plantains, lured me back after months of no Blue Apron. All the ingredients and instructions were great. However, in the end I have to say my family is not a fan of mashed plantains :( We've only ever had them fried before, at restaurants. Even after concluding plantains are not for us, we still ate up everything. In this case the whole was more than the sum of the parts. Putting everything together tasted better than trying the various parts individually.

Wow, this was fantastic!!!! Unfortunately, my chicken arrived opened and all the juices drained to the bottom of the box. I'm a bit skeptical of chicken in that condition so I tossed it, but used the vegtable recipe to pair with this. It was great! This steak was so tender and tasty.

This service is certainly expanding my horizons. Steak on plantains? Whodathunkit?

Thanks BA!

I have been meaning to comment from time to time about the Blue Apron recipes and ingredients since I started receiving it. Could not pass up the opportunity to state how incredible this particular recipe was. I am from the deep South where we have a heavy African and Creole influence on our food, and we are known throughout the world for our cuisine. The flavors in this dish were exotic and perfectly combined.

This meal was good! I used Lori's tips (see below) and they were very helpful, thank you. I made the recipe mostly as instructed, the only thing I would have done differently is to put the steak on a grill; we don't really care for pan-fried steak, especially a good cut of rib eye. We enjoyed the "sweet and sour" mix between the plantain and lime juice, very interesting combo, but the peanut/ginger topping wasn't worth the effort.

So far I am loving Blue Apron! Most recipes are easy to prepare and they turn out delicious :) I only cook for one, so I easily have leftovers to make other simple dishes. One question I have is about the zesting... the video shows peeling the rind, dicing it and setting aside and then also using a zester for the white pith. Which one do we use in the recipe? Or can you use one or the other when the recipe calls for zest?

Great quality steak. Such a difference in the flavor in comparison to store bought steak. Mashed plantains, never had them mashed like this but I like the idea. This meal was so tasty and I absolutely love the combination. It had so much flavor. One of my favorite recipes. Keep up the good work BA.

Try this with your plantains (minor tweaks but wow the difference!) ... add the finely minced ginger to the plantains when cooking, and a tablespoon of Knorr's Caldo de Pollo (my go-to for stocks and about most everything!). Drain. Add the lime zest. Then fork mash with double the butter and a bit of 1/2 & 1/2. Yes, it's high in calories and fat, but it's incredibly tasty. Since I don't do Starbucks or otherwise imbibe, I indulge in other ways, this being one of them.

I steamed my plantain in the pressure cooker for 7 minutes. It was delicious with the lime zest! I had to use my mini food processor to smash up those seeds of paradise, because smashing them wasn't so easy. We really loved all the flavors of this dish-- especially the ginger peanuts. I will definitely make this again, with a bigger rib-eye steak and double the plantain. Excellent recipe!

I loved all the flavors in this meal. My only complaint is the steak! My husband thought it was a bit tough and had too much fat on it. I think I would make this again but use a filet Mignon; it's what we eat if we have a steak. I still would give this a 5 out of 5! It would also be good with chicken or pork tenderloin.

Did anyone else notice that their steak had these little tiny holes all over it after cooking? I've never seen anything like it before and it totally freaked me out. When I sliced the meat to serve it I noticed the holes and I just couldn't serve it to my two toddlers. It just seemed so weird. I have been a loyal BA client for over a year and have never seen this so I was just wondering if anyone else saw that too. Thanks!

One of my favorite Blue Apron meals to date; the ginger peanuts were a nice touch. We didn't crush them; they were already pretty coarsely chopped. For those who complained that the plaintains didn't have much flavor, I thought plating the dish as shown on the photo allowed the collards, plantains, steak and garnish flavors to blend nicely.

Question: It seems many are having a difficult time crushing the grains of paradise with the pan edge, and I don't have a mortar and pestle or a pepper grinder. Can I use an electric coffee grinder to do this job, or would that render them too fine?

Loved this recipe. I made a substitution that may help others who are allergic to bananas (and yes, plantains are in the banana family). I took a small red yam, peeled and cubed and prepared in the same way as the plantain. It added a little sweet touch, was pretty and in no way changed the overall delicacy of the rest of the dish.

This is one of the best steak dinner from Blue Apron. The quality of the ribeye steak I got was much better than many prior steaks from Blue Apron meals. Even I overcooked the steak a bit, it wasn't tough at all. I would cook the steak for a slightly shorter time than recommended (2-3 minutes per side), especially if you have flattened it with a meat tenderizer.

This was a really great meal - and I was surprised that the steak was really good (in general, Blue Apron's beef has been a weak spot), if on the small side. After trimming the huge strip of fat from the side, I had 8.1 oz of mostly meat - it was one piece, not two as shown.

I've never used grains of paradise before, and although it was OK, I don't think it is something I'd use again. I tried crushing the seeds with a pot as directed but then got out my pestle & mortar to finish.

I loved the lime zest in the plantains; as others had noted, it was a bit dry, so I added another pat of butter a...See More

Hubby really liked this....me it was just OK. The plantain was creamy but lots sweeter than potatoes. Just be prepared. In my opinion collards need to be cooked longer. I really liked the grains of paradise. I agree with Lori Burton...forget the pot for crushing and go straight to the rolling pin.

This was an excellent meal with great layerng of flavors and textures. I would absolutely make it again. I did make a couple changes to make it a bit easier/more appealing to my likes and dislikes. First, I started by simmering the collards for about 90 minutes earlier in the day because I like my collards soft and falling apart. I cooked them in a covered pan with a cup or two of water (I added more if I though it might get too dry) and then to the fridge they went. When I was done cooking the steak I added the cooked collards to the pan to get the flavor of the fond and it was great! Second, I have a molcajete style mortar and pestle which I used for both the grains of paradise and the herb sauce. It ground the grains up nicely and it worked aces on the sauce--it basically turned the parsley into a paste that melted into the lime juice and oil. If you have a mortar and pestle I highly suggest breaking it out for this recipe!

I really enjoyed this meal! I've only ever seen collards cooked long and slow and I never thought to sauté them - a nice change up from my usual spinach. I like them a little softer so I upped the water and let them cook a little longer - perfect. I usually like to follow the recipe because it encourages me to try things I've never had but as soon as I saw the plantain I knew I had to try making my own platanos maduros. I followed the recipe for boiling them and meanwhile made a little brown sugar glaze and then sautéed them in that. I added the peanuts and lime to finish them for a little brightness and crunch. It wasn't quite as good as what I've had at Cuban restaurants but still pretty yummy!

So I just made this, and I have to say, the flavors are AWESOME. Few things though:

The ingredients actually differ a bit in the recipe card than what is posted here. Instead of 2 sirloin steaks, it now comes with one ribeye steak. The top sirloin they send is usually very tough, so I REALLY appreciated the tenderness of the ribeye (however it was poorly cut and there was only a small amount of meat and the rest was fat and gristle :/ )

And maybe it was just me, but it looks like you're supposed to receive 4 collard green leaves, and I only received 2, which cooked down to very little.

This turned out ok. I give it 4/5 rating. What I was dissapointed about is that I only received 1 steak, this shows 2 top sirloin steaks. I'm a griller and a smoker of meats.
