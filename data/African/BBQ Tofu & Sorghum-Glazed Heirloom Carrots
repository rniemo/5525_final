I found that 1/2 a cup of water was too much for the carrots... after double the time, it still didn't evaporate. Next time, I'll try only 1/4 cup. Similarly, the millet took much longer for all the liquid to absorb. However, overall, this dish turned out great and had some super delicious flavors!

I agree with Audrey about less water for the carrots and cooking the millet longer. I would also be generous with the salt in the millet pilaf and perhaps add a splash of cream. The tofu had an amazing consistency, I don't like my tofu mushy and this is like extra extra firm. You can get that deep fried thai style tofu consistency without deep frying it. Of course, I pan fried it extra long on all sides just in case. Overall dish was amazing!
