It is best to prep the ingredients as directed. The meals I've received are absolutely delicious and have opened our palettes to many new flavors. It has been easy to cancel deliveries on the calendar when necessary. Can't wait for next week's shipment. XOXO

It's a shame- the "lamb" recipes look great, but you can't get it if you eat lamb but not beef because they only ship a "lamb and beef blend".

This was our dinner last night and my 4 y/o was able to help in the prep and my entire family including my 13 month old devoured the meatballs and my husband even liked the squash salad! Great flavor combination on both the salad and the meatballs & great job Blue Apron ! This morning my 4 y/o asked "what's for dinner tonight"

This was our first blue apron meal and while it was fun to make and I'm happy to try something new and different, this meal just wasn't to my taste. The mint was a bit overpowering. The squash salad was very tasty by itself but a bit odd to have it on top of the meatballs.
I'm very excited to try the other meals and if for some reason I dislike some of those as well it's ok. At least I'm trying new things that I never would have thought to make and I'm learning to cook a variety of different things.

As an olive lover I was dissapointed in the use of the olives in this recipe. They were totally overpowered by the lemon in the salad. I wish I had just used salt in the recipe instead and eaten the yummy, yummy olives on their own. Mmmmm, olives....

Loved the summer squash salad. I didn't add all the lemon juice as I thought it would be overpowering; I used half the lemon and I think I could have used only a quarter, but it was very light, refreshing and I loved the mint undertone. A great way to use up that summer squash from the garden!

I definitely let my sauce cook down too long and the flavor got too concentrated - it was just kinda salty and acidic (so don't do that). But overall they were fine as far as meatballs go.

Otherwise a nice dish. I loved the the salad, and I'm not normally a fan of squash so it was great to find a way to make it taste amazing! It was fresh and crunchy, and the lemon mint flavors almost made it taste pickled. It was great! (I didn't serve it on top of the meatballs as I thought that was weird).

Isn't it weird how we all have different tastes? I thought this was really good. My meatballs didn't taste spicy at all, but they were still yummy. I actually thought the squash salad went great because the meat was super rich and it helped balance that out. I probably wouldn't make again just because it was so rich. I probably used too much oil.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made my meatballs pretty small, so they cooked through no problem. I may have added too much oil to the pan of meatballs, but it was alright since I took the excess oil to a pot of water to make pasta. I wanted to stretch the meal, so I served the meatballs with some angel hair pasta and it was good. I did not have as much excess sauce as shown in the picture, but the meatballs were very well seasoned, so it worked with the pasta. The bread was also very tasty and I will be making it this way again. I liked the side salad. It was light and refreshing and balanced out what would otherwise have been a heavy meal.

I left out the garlic toast but otherwise did everything else. The meatballs combined very well and for the most part stayed together in the pan. Meatballs and sauce had a great taste, lots of spice. Salad wonderful too. Hubbie thought rice on the side would be good. Me too. Snacking on side so not as filling as others. Will do again.

Over this was a very good recipe. I would like to make this again with the exception of adding RAW garlic to the bread. I omitted that (didn't want the garlic to be spicy and potent) and covered the meatballs while they simmered to make sure they cooked all the way through. The summer squash salad was a fresh addition.

I'm another that didn't have enough sauce: I don't know if 3/4 cup of water just isn't enough or if I cooked it down a bit too much. I had almost no extra sauce at all. My boyfriend liked the meatballs; I thought they were ok. He didn't like raw squash; I actually liked it. The garlic toasts were - uh - garlic toasts; it would have been hard to mess those up. I'd give this a 3 out of 5.

I really liked the salad, but something in the spice blend was really over powering---maybe the thyme? Also--getting a little sick of all the lemons! I wish I'd tasted it before I squeezed the whole lemon in. I could barely taste the mint or olive. I also put the garlic on BEFORE I toasted the bread because raw garlic would have been gross.

second the suggestion the tip on adding the lemon to taste. I wish that I hadn't used it all, lol...but considering I didn't care much/understand the mint in it.. and ended up with a zuchinni I'm not sure that less lemon would have made much of a difference in my case. Not a fan of this particular meal, but I should mention that it's only the 2nd meal and first mistake in over a year of ordering

I've found the BA folks to be very helpful. The only food problems I had were a direct result of the box being crushed during dilivery. I brought the problem to BApron's attention and the refunded me the cost of the damaged produce.
The only times I've had a delay with delivery is the couple of times I had to give them a different method to charge to.

Others seem to like this, but it wasn't my favorite. The citrus salad and the meatballs (with mint mixed in) seemed to clash rather than compliment, for me. To each their own taste, I guess. At least I got to practive my meatball skills. They are improving :-) I had a little extra tomato paste around the house and used that to thicken the sauce a bit beyond what was provided, which was nice.

This is on up there as one of my fav meals from BA. At first, the summer salad seemed like such an odd pairing with the meatballs but it worked so well together. I ripped up my bread and put it straight in the bowl so I could get better proportioned bites. We didn't have an issue with extra oil or grease from the meatballs, maybe because we used coconut oil.

I didn't see the spice packet for the meatballs so I improvised from the instruction sheet. I'm not sure that I was accurate in amounts. I froze the bread since I was unable to make this dish when it came. I served over Trader Joe's lemon pepper pasta. The sauce didn't seem like it would be enough; it's tomato season here in upstate NY so I tossed in some fresh tomatoes with the paste to make extra sauce. I followed the advice of others and removed some oil before the sauce. I didn't think I'd like the squash uncooked, but it was very good! I enjoyed the meal for a summer change of pace dinner.

The meatballs were okay, but a little bland. At first I thought maybe I hadn't mixed them well and any second I'd bite down into a super spicy meatball, but no, that's just how they were. I'm not crazy about raw squash, so I added the squash salad ingredients to the pan while cooking the sauce. Then, I put the cooked squash on top of the toast (which I also altered by putting garlic paste and the rest of the parmesan on top) and that was delicious.

I have never ever cooked a meal for myself, but wanted to try so I subscribed to Blue Apron. This was my first home-cooked meal ever and the recipe was very easy to follow along! With that said, I burnt my meatballs and seasoned them with too much salt, but other than that it was overall a very pleasant, fun experience. And it still tasted delicious. I loved the lemony squash salad combination with the meatballs. They were perfect together. So thank you, Blue Apron! :) (still can't believe I made garlic bread, summer squash salad, AND meatballs all by myself!)

Didn't love this one. Too much grease in the pan not to pour some off.The herb mix was way too strong; my meatballs came out mediciney. Half that amount would have been plenty.
