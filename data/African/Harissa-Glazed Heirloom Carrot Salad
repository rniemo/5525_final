I'm pretty sure I read somewhere that you can customize your meals.

I am not much of a cook but I did heirloom carrot salad with spinach couscous and I really liked it surprsising myself. It took me a lot longer than it says but I had trouble cutting the carrots. I did let the carrots and onions cook a little longer than it said cause I don't like real raw veggies.

I got my first order yesterday. I don't eat beef or lamb much so I marked no beef or lamb. They put in a lamb dish anyway so I changed it to vegetarian. First thing I tried was the asparagus ricotta sandwich. It was a little bland but ok. Tonight I made the heirloom carrot salad with spinach couscous. The couscous was good but the carrot salad was terrible. We couldn't eat it. So disappointing because the heirloom carrots were so beautiful. Unless the last meal is really exceptional we won't be getting this again. It's a shame you can't personalize meals a little more because this is perfect with just the two of us at home now.

I thought this was pretty good. It benefits from sitting, even the next day. And is better with a squeeze of lemon (but what isn't). I used about 1/2 the molasses and added some cauliflower and mini bell peppers to the carrots. I like this kind of meal as a lunch so saved it for the next day.

This was delicious! I have never had flavors like this before, the harissa paste and date syrup were amazing additions, sweet and spicy. loved it.

I e just placed my first order. I need you to know I am highly allergic to LEMON. All other citrus okay. Also don't tolerate spicy pepper hot flavors. Can we still be friends. Everything sounds so yummy!
