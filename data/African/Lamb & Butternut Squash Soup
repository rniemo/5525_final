We LOVED this soup. If I wanted to increase the servings to 10 ppl how much butternut squash would I need? I forgot to measure when I made the soup to see how much "1/2 a squash" turned out to be....

Blue Apron the recipe card and the cooking directions are contradictory. Are we getting merguez lamb sausage or ground lamb and a spice blend? If it's a spice blend, what are the spices?

I can't eat corriander so I won't be able to use the spice blend - what would be a good spice I could add to season the lamb instead?

Why do I have lamb unchecked in my diet requests and it still shows up on my menu option?

This soup is absolutely delicious. It was my favorite of all three meals for the week and it was very easy to make. Will definitely make this again!

Hubby LOVED this soup! I did have to cook the barley a considerably longer time to get the texture we like, but that was no big deal. I loved the addition of spinach-- way to sneak in the vitamins.

Barley takes way longer than 15 min. Actually takes about 50.

I forgot butternut squash so I added sweet potatoes, and I used lentils instead of barley. I also added chicken bouillon cubes and extra water to make more soup. Kale would have been better in the soup instead of spinach since spinach gets very wilted. Overall delicous soup.
