More of a pre-cook tip, but if you find your pea shoots getting slimy before ready to use just throw a paper towel in the bag to soak up the moisture.

While I wasn't exactly enthused about this selection, I have to say we quite enjoyed it. Surprisingly filling and quite flavorful, it kind of reminded us of a 'Middle-Eastern Bibimbap'. Did not follow the recipe exactly (we never do - I guess you could call us 'adventurous types'). Would NOT recommend 'finely mincing' the pea shoots or adding once removed from the heat, I saw that turning into a limp, stringy mess. I added mine just before serving. If we made this again I'd bake the pita chips for less time (maybe 5-6 minuts) and once the eggs were added I'd bake this for less time as well as ...See More

We liked it even though I forgot to add the pea shoots to the pan. I mixed them in as best as I could after the eggs and it was fine. It would be nice if each step was indicated with a bullet to make it easier to read (and harder to miss!) The pita was delicious with the sprinkling of the spices.

I made this yesterday and ate leftovers again today. Both times it wrecked my digestive system. I thought it was delicious, but I wouldn't eat again for that reason. I've never had a problem with the foods that were included before, so I'm wondering if it had something to do with the ingredients or the way I cooked it since I'm not seeing anyone else had the same problem...

When your 14 year old son apologizes for thinking this was going to be a miss and that I should have made it when it first came (in on 9/16 & I made it on 10/7), I count this as a HUGE tasty win! When I make this again, I'll leave out the Feta; it didn't do much for the dish and my husband isn't a fan of Feta.

I really enjoyed this one however I did struggle with cooking the potatoes in my stainless steel pan. After a bit I just switched to a cast iron pan which was easier however I did not want to use that one to make the sauce. I think if I had been able to succesfully brown the potatoes in the stainless pan then deglaze the bits that did stick while making the sauce that would have added a nice element. I'll need to practice at cooking those potatoes this way!

Took double the time listed in the recipe and they gave us straight up goat cheese instead of feta ... it ruined the dish for us and we ended up just having pita chips for dinner ... I'm sticking with Home Chef from now on ..

I thought this was delicious but I should not have added the Feta. It ruined it for me. It seemed to sour the whole dish. Next time I will be sure to just serve it on the side. I normally love feta in any dish but this became almost too sour goat cheese like, and I do not like goat cheese at all.

My husband thought this was one of the best recipes so far but I guess I'm not a fan of Za'atar spices. I'd rate it a 2/5 where he rates the meal a 5/5. I would order this meal again but I might change the spices up for my taste...maybe go with mediterranean spices (McCormick's Mediterranean Spiced Sea Salt would be an great choice). Loved the concept though.

We did not like this at all, it didn't have much flavor to me. The pea shoots were a bad texture, almost stringy, in the mix. I would leave them out. I had to research online and make my own Zaatar because this recipe came without it's bag of knick knacks. Thank goodness I had tomato sauce but we unfortunately had to do without the feta cheese because we didn't have that on hand.

This recipe came out great, despite some bumps along the way. First off, I think the amount of required oil is way off in most of the recipes (2 tsp). I couldn't fry the potatoes in so little oil, they stuck to the non-stick pan like crazy, I had to add at least another 2 tsp of oil to get them going, then I ended up using another non-stick pan to make the sauce b/c I had burned stuck pieces of potatoes that I coudln't scrub off b/c the pan was hot. Same happened with the shallots& peppers, the moment I added the tomato paste it burned instantly and turned black and so much smoke came out in a matter of seconds that I thought the smoke detector was going to go off.
The prep time is grossly underestimated!!! It took me 40 minutes from lining up the ingredients on the counter to having everything chopped up in bowls. Is the prep time listed for two people? B/c for one person you'd have to be Superman/woman to finish all the prep in 15 minutes.

I love shakshuka, and this was no different. I agree with a previous comment that this did feel more like a hash because of the large amount of potatoes; next time, I'll probably add more tomato sauce. I think also I'd cut everything more uniform (ie: small dice the tinkerbells). The rings were hard to scoop up.

This was so easy to prepare, I use a ceramic knife to cut and chop the veggies. I used my cast iron skillet to cook everything in my gas oven and the dish was awesome. I would make this again.���

Since I am not a vegetarian and don't like eggs, I'd like to find a way to make this meal more appealing and satisfying. (BA makes me take their choice of a veg meal, since I really want the two meat dishes this week.) I could simply add chickien, or just repurpose the other ingredients, but I'd like to be more creative. Any ideas?

I have oven-safe cast iron and stainless steel pans, not non-stick. Most non-stick pans are not oven-safe or are only rated for 350 degrees. If anyone knows of a non-stick pan that is oven-safe to 450 degrees, please link.

I made this dish tonight and loved it. I'm thinking about making the whole thing again on my own, maybe next to some scrambled eggs instead of the baked egg. Yum!

I love this idea and it looks tasty but feels way more like a breakfast/brunch hash with eggs than a Shakshuka.

I'm not that into egg yolks, so I scrambled the eggs. I liked it a lot, but my boyfriend thought it could use more spice.

I was excited for this dish because durring my time in Afghanistan I fell in love with a dish I only know as egg and tomato. This seemed really similar so I wanted to try it. I was disappointed it seemed like too many flavors over complicated the dish. I really wanted to love it. I think if I were to make it again I would leave out the pea shootsand cheese and only use half of the peppers.

Seems like everything took twice as much time to cook as indicated, the finished product after baking was still more watery than saucy, and then once my egg whites were set, the yolks were overdone. If I make it again, I will poach the eggs seperately and then add. Probably my least favorite of the 5 meals so far and yet, I see the possibilities for improvement.

This is delicious. Not sure why, the ingredients are so simple. The comination of potatoes and tomatoes achieves an unexpected amazing texture. Only downside is the photo of the Tinkerbell peppers makes them appear huge, each was maybe 1.5 inches in length.

Seemed overly time consuming for what is basically eggs and hash. Pea shoots didn't add anything to the dish in my opinion.
Wouldn't choose this again.

Loved this recipe. I didn't cut the peppers right but the overall consistency and flavor was great. I added some cayanne pepper in there to spice things up.
