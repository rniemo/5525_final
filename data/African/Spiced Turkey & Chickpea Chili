Def in the top 5 best BA meals (I've been with BA for 6 months). Its easy to prepare, large portions and very unique flavors. I would definitely make this again, assuming I can find the spice blend at one of the places that others have mentioned below. I dont usually like eggplant, but the way it was cooked in this recipe was great. it wasnt a weird texture. in fact, it felt like it made the chili even meatier and thicker.

Made this today, was delicious and all of us liked it. The eggplant we got was huge so I only used 2/3 of it... And only put in 1.5 cups water. It'd enough to feed a family - we are 5 and had leftovers.

Probably the best recipe for me this week. I didn't mind the lemon flavor and everything combined really well and came out very flavorful.
I did end up getting a *very* big eggplant, so ended up using half of it. Too much eggplant will distract the flavor of other ingredients.

This was great! Definitely serves three without any additions - I easily filled three large soup bowls to the top. The croutons were amazing - the technique of salting pan fried foods right after you pull them off the heat has been one of my favorite things to learn from BA. I didn't care for the chermoula. I love cilantro, but my lemon was pretty juicy and the chermoula ended up really agressively lemon-y and didn't work that well with the chili. I ended up simmering mine for about 30 minutes to serve at the right time and the eggplant still help up well, although I did do more of a large dice. I'm eating the leftovers right now for lunch and they are delicious.

This was amazing! :) The recipe had not gaffas, and the textures and flavors are outstanding. It made six cups of chili which was easily tupperwareable for lunches -- and the labneh and croutons as well. Everything tasted so fresh and delicious.

Incredible the next day! There was something about the spices that were off-putting the night off, before they had had a chance to "marry" in the fridge. I honestly couldn't even get it down. But it worked out, because I had more the next day! Beautifully thick and creamy chili with a depth of flavor. He and I fought over bites of leftovers.

My advice, don't eat Moroccan food that night. Core to Moroccan cooking, in my opinion, is the low and slow blending of flavors.

Another great turkey chili recipe from BA. We had a bunch of garden tomatoes that I diced and tossed into the mix with the chickpeas. If you do something like this, cut back a little on the added water. Alternatively you could let the chili simmer longer. Also, make sure you season the dish appropriately with any added ingredients. Our labneh-lemon mixture was a little runny, as was the cilantro paste. I would hold back on the lemon juice in both garnishes next time. Otherwise, this was an excellent kick-off to autumn.

I was dubious about this recipe as I am not a big fan of eggplant, but it turned out to be a lovely surprise and the best BA meal of the week (even tho I thought it a bit too light on the turkey). For the leftovers I added meat from a turkey burger I had on hand, made another batch of the cilantro sauce and substituted a bit of grated monterey jack for the lableh. The recipe made four generous servings, and I enjoyed them all!

What I wish I had known before I started: The eggplant completly broke down once I added the meat and started browning it. This wasn't necessarily a bad thing, but if I cared enough about having intact eggplant I would cook it separately and add it at the end. Overall, mushy eggplant notwithstanding, we really liked this meal and will be making it again very soon.

Left the eggplant out from the get-go; all it serves to do is pad out the content of the chili, and the resultant texture I knew would be objectionable. As a result, this was one of the best dishes I've had from Blue Apron thus far (though I suppose that's not really saying a whole lot); the chickpeas were nice and tender, the turkey adding just the right amount of meat flavor and texture, and the spice blend making everything come together. Probably would have been better with about 1/2 the onion, but still wasn't bad. The labneh was perfect, something I honestly didn't expect; my experience with mixing citrus juices in other Blue Apron dishes was highly disgusting, but this came out great. Finally, the pita croutons were to die for; I had to stop myself from eating them off the plate while cooking the chili itself.

This was the best recipe of the week by far. I loved the spices and the flavors. The chermola and labneh mixture was excellent and half those pita croutons disappeared before the dish was served! I did half the eggplant since it is one of my least favorite vegetables and the final cooking time wasn't nearly as long as it needed to be to thicken up the sauces so I helped it out with some rice starch. Overall, quite delicious.

I totally enjoyed this tonight. It was very flavorful. I used half the lemon zest and half the lemon, because the BA home chef’s said it was too much. I also simmered the chili for about twenty minutes. It reduced the sauce to a much thicker consistency. The pita was a nice touch and gave the dish a good crunch. The chermoula didn’t come out right. It was too garlicky, but the cilantro is a nice touch, use half, otherwise it’s overpowering. As my first Chili I have to say it was delicous! I can see making this again with lamb and other type of beans. Thanks BA, your on a roll this week!

I made a few modifications to this one, but the two most important were about the eggplant. After cooking/browning it I removed it and set it aside in a glass bowl while I continued cooking the rest. Had I left it on pan while trying to break down the meat, it would have gotten mushy. Also I used about 2/3 of the eggplant and I'm very happy about that. Otherwise the ratio of eggplant to chili would have been too high.

Accidentally left the labneh out for the week while we were out of town, so had to toss it. Substituted cotija and that was still just fine.

A few other notes - I don't like eggplant and substituted cauliflower from another of the recipes from last week, and that was a tasty substitution. Added in some sweet peppers (red and orange) and actually ended up adding about a 1/2 cup of spicy black beans, just because I had them in the fridge and wanted to bulk up the portion size a bit more.

I would love the spice proportions as well! I have a Ras El Hanout recipe, but it looks like the spice blend included some other items. REH can also be found on Penzey's spices, but I use a recipe from Well Fed. I eat Paleo, but I let the flour in the spice slide. I did leave the beans out of the pot (but warmed them) so my husband who isn't eating Paleo could just add them into his dish. It was great! I hope to make it again.
