Cream cheese is similar to Labneh cheese, but doesn't have the tang from the yogurt. You can also get a similar flavor profile for the Ras El Hanout with Paprika, ginger, saffron, and coriander.

Really good one! Husband hardly missed any meat. It did make a lot of coucous but i had cooked it in broth instead of water so it added to the dish quite a lot. Warm but not too hot. Loved the cheese topping and the mint. Try this one for sure.

I am excited to try this, I always follow the recipes exact the first time, If I make it again I might change up a few things but so far so good!

Recipe assumes too much knowledge. "Medium dice the eggplant." Do I include the skin or not? The seeds inside or not? The ends or not?
