I realize these comments were posted in 2015, but in response the questions on ratio of the Shakshuka Spice blend...Za'atar is already a spice blend and contains half the ingredients to make the Shakshuka Spice Blend. It seem redundant to add most of the same ingredients, "thyme, sumac, and salt back into it." It also contains seseme seeds, cumin, oregano, and black pepper. Depending on how spicy you want it, go lighty on the Aleppo peppers and use about 1/2 the garlic powder. Use equal portions except for the peppers and garlic. Sumac is very delicious on it's own and is mainly used in place of salt. If you are salt sensative cut out the salt all together.

I am very much an egg skeptic but I made this recipe as is and OMG, I might be a convert! The eggs poached wonderfully and the mixture is so delicious! We had the version with shallots in lieu of the red onion and this really tasted nicely. My husband and I also just warmed out pita up and used it to scoop up the potato/pepper/egg goodness.

If you cover the pan with a lid, could you just cont. on the top of the stove with this in step 6. ????

This is what makes Blue Apron so great, you get to try out things with out a huge investment. I've had this before and it wasn't one of my options or I didn't choose it...anyway I still wanted to make it again, because it is great....so I ended up buying the spices, cost of the three spices, over !8 dollars....

I agree we don't eat pita bread in North Africa.

I also added 2 more eggs. This was delish! This was not a delivery for us, I just made it on my own. I didn't really measure the spices, I just added as I went along and tasted; just salt, pepper, aleppo pepper and za'atar. The flavors are mild enough to do this. Unless you don't like a lot of spice, then maybe less aleppo pepper, but we love heat so I just kept adding.

Yum! Added two more eggs... More than enough for 4 peeps.

I was skeptical about this, but it turned quite delicious. I wish I had thought to add extra egg. It easily made 3 servings.

Anyone made this yet? How spicy is it if I use the whole spice packet? We only like a little heat in foods.

I generally let things cook a bit longer in each step, 2-3 minutes. Came out quite good. Not particularly spicy, but aleppo pepper does linger, so be aware of that.

Also cut water to 1 cup, knowing how BA tends to overdo it. Could have cut back as far as 3/4, but turned out good anyway. Would not recommend pouring the entire 1 1/3 in at one time in any case.

Yes, just use a shallow pan, such as a skillet.

A lovely little skillet dish and the fresh pitas were a perfect accompaniment.

Loved this recipe. I was thinking that it might be good served as a dip if I don't add the egg. Any suggestions on what to add? Maybe sour cream or cream cheese to make it thicker for a dip?
