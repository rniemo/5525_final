This was really good. I had to cook the sweet potatoes a little longer than indicated (I used a cast iron skillet.) Also, the eggplant skins came out a little tough so I think I would peel them next time. This is a great stove top recipe.

when cooking that couscous, do you turn the heat off once you put the couscous in the boiling water?

I used cashew butter instead of peanut butter. It was delicious. My boyfriend and I definitely enjoyed this dish !!!

Yummy recipe! I made it in the crockpot and used crunchy peanut butter. The long cooking time made the peanuts soft.

This is a very simple and homey recipe that is also quite versatile: you can throw whatever vegetable you fancy in. I think I will try some herbs next time to add some extra flavor.

A few months ago I made this dish from the recipe and not from a weekly shipment because I love anything made from peanut butter! I doubled (or maybe even tripled) the recipe. While my spouse enjoyed it, he didn't mind if I ate the leftovers. And wow, did I enjoy the leftovers! I gladly ate the dish for lunch the rest of the week, and each day the flavors were even more delicious.
