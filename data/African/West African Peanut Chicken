I cut off the skin which was just nicer and took away some useless fat/calories. Wish I'd have butterflied it as well actually. Didn't use two bowls for the sauces... just did the peanut butter and then put the milk powder in with the water and whisked the whole mess together which was fine. Use a large pan for more surface area and the sauce will reduce just fine. This dish was delicious. I could have licked the plate.

BLUE APRON: It would be awesome if you could find a supplier for real coconut milk. Seriously. And, personally, I do not like the reformatting of the recipe cards and find this new format much more difficult to look at. The six, blocked out photographs with directions below each picture were much nicer and easier to follow. IMO.

My girlfriend and I have been cooking Blue Arpon meals for about a half year now and we absolutely love it! This recipe was by far one of the better ones we've had. Please continue to implment ethnic dishes as they often are scrumptous! Also, yes, like everyone is saying please consider coconut milk. Also, have you also consdiered a desert option for some of these boxes? I know I for one would pay an extra $5-10 a box for desserts.

Remember to use hot water for coconut powder. Pour cold tap water and then microwave it. Will make a big difference to minimize clumping. Still use a small sieve/strainer before using the mixture and you'll get a perfect clum-free concoction.

In reading through these instructions, I counted eight instructions to season with salt and pepper, and one instruction to add a big pinch of salt to the rice/water - ? I get that I don't need to season with s/p each time, but good grief that seems pretty repetitive, particularly with all of the other flavors and the spice blend that are part of the recipe...

I wouldn't have seen myself ever cooking anything like this, which is the great value of BlueApron. It turned out way better than I'd have thought, with a few key changes:
- wish I'd sliced the chicken skin off, made it harder to eat; after cooking, I sliced the breasts into 4-5 pieces allowing it to absorb more sauce
- sauce was kinda flat, and 3 garlic cloves was too much, added a spoonful of chunky peanut butter for texture, much better, and small spoon of yogurt to thicken; but I like a sweet tang and added several swirls of honey - and since I envisioned it a bit more Indian than African,...See More

This turned out very good. I only added 1 cup water to the coconut milk powder, and about 2/3 of the spice packet. (The spice packet definitely has a kick to it) I added about 2 tsp of sugar to the peanut sauce as well... This made it taste more like canned coconut milk. There was plenty of sauce on the dish and it thickened up nicely with only 1 cup water.

My husband and I really enjoyed this. I too cut off the skin. I followed Mark Gazdik's tip and cut the chicken in 4-5 large chunks before adding to the peanut sauce. This way I can give my hubbie a bit more protein since he needs it more than I do. Every chance I get I use coconut oil instead of olive oil and this recipe was perfect for that. I used ALL the spice, we love spicy but I felt it was more flavor than too much spice. I don't mind the coconut powder and followed a cook's tip and heated the coconut powder and water in the microwave 30 secs. It blended perfectly, no clumps! Plus...See More

Pretty tasty Overall. I wish I'd read tips earlier because I agree on the coconut milk powder. I have coconut milk (canned) and I would have used it. The sauce was good. But thin. I like the idea of adding some yogurt. I have way too much sauce but I have leftover rice from Chinese food the other night so I'm just gonna pour it over that. I like the idea of slicing the chicken to soak up the sauce and removing skin. I don't like skin on my chicken and I should have cut it off. Just a personal preference. But all in all a nice different dish and I enjoyed it.

What a disappointment! I had beautifully seared chicken breasts and then was directed to cook them an additional 8 minutes in the peanut-coconut milk sauce. They were over-cooked!

Loved the flavor of the sauce and the contrast of the kale to balance the meal. It could've used a little bit of a kick, if I made it again would probably add a dash of chili powder to the sauce. Also on the topic of the sauce - don't underestimate cooking down the sauce. Use a large enough pan to help spread the heat to reduce th sauce. I also gave it an extra minute or two while I plated the rest and ultimately ended up with what looked like a third or less of what I started with. Last tip, if you're a good multitasker or have a helper, you could cut a large chunk of cook time out by starting the sauce in a new pan at the same time as cooking the kale.

So, I wish the instructions had mentioned using HOT water in the coconut milk...and still it was too much water. Since I cannot tolerate much spice, I had to halve the ginger and just use a pinch of the spice blend. Still got that funny licorice taste, but the sauce was too watery and pretty bland. I like the kale, but there wasn't much of it. Not my favorite recipe, but the chicken (love chicken skin!) cooked up juicy and tasty! I used bacon grease instead of olive oil, and I think that helped the chicken and the kale.

I loved the sauce on this dish! As it seems some others did, I cut the skin off the chicken (I generally prefer skinless, but especially with such a thick sauce I didn't think the skin was at all necessary). I also used pearled barley I had on hand instead of the white rice, and it went really well with everything - slightly nutty, slightly chewy, just lovely. I layered everything in a bowl, sauce on top, and it was great. So flavorful and with a nice heat.
I agree with others who would prefer coconut milk to the powder. It's hard to get all the chunks in the powder broken down and mixed in! ...See More

We loved this dish. I don't have an issue with the powdered coconut milk. Does it have less fat content than canned, the way buttermilk powder does? Just wondering. One thing I am sad to see is that Blue Apron seems to have returned to their former practice of not listing the exact ingredients in spice blends. Even without knowing the proportions, having the specific ingredients named was helpful.

I wound up just using coconut milk in this because it's not hard to get coconut milk? I have never seen this powdered version before. I know most longtime users know this, but err on the side of caution with salting. I'm not sure why every single step says to salt, but it's so unncessary. I also agree with the comments I've seen about the recipe card. My eye doesn't follow this as easily at all. A great example for recipe cards? Home Chef. Their cards are easy to follow.

Only 3 meals in with Blue Apron, this one is the favorite to date! This was a very flavorful meal and the rice and kale were great sides. I took reviewers advice and did the following: 1. Made sure to use very hot water when mixing the coconut powder and peanut butter, the recipe should definitely state this in the directions. 2. Grated the ginger on a small plane rather than mincing, which was much easier. 3. After frying up the chicken breast (and yes I left the skin on) I cut into 4 pieces (still leaving each breast as a "whole" and then added to the sauce. This allowed for the sauce to get to more of the chicken and it was much easier to eat.

Total time was more than stated on the recipe. It was closer to an hour and 15, 20 minutes rather than the stated hour. Extra time was worth it for the great dinner. ”

We made this last night and with a few tweaks, it was pretty good.
1. I took the skin off the chicken and cut it in smaller pieces, that way it was crispy all over and juicy inside.
2. I am not a fan of the coconut powder and i'm actually allergic to coconut, so i added half and half to the sauce and let it cook longer.
3. I had 1/4 head of cauliflower, so after i cooked the chicken, i added them to the pan and quickly sauteed them. They were really great with the sauce and gave it a crunch.
4. I didn't add the chicken to the sauce, but added it on the side. That way we had extra sauce when we wanted it.
This was pretty good. I'd make it again. My husband really liked the sauce.

Without question, this selection is the biggest pain in the neck to make. The "guidance" on the recipe card advising that this can be made in a total of 50-60 minutes is nothing more than fiction. Blue Apron must be more accurate in these estimates OR rate each recipe on a difficulty scale. I've encountered this too often, and am leaning to canceling the service.

BTW, I have no idea if this recipe produces a good meal or not. I'm typing this while waiting for the sauce to reduce. Dinner was supposed to be on the table 45 minutes ago.

This was one of my least favorites. Maybe I didn't like the spices or maybe it was the lumpy coconut powder with the new format of the recipe cards. The coconut this time I could not get the lumps out. It took forever for the sauce to thicken even using a large skillet. In my own cooking coconut milk in the cartons is soooo much easier. What is the advantage to the power. With regard to the cards, I had my ritual and timing down. The new format was not easier to follow. Is the quaility of the cards the same?

Made this tonight. 1.5 cups water for the coconut milk powder was too much, use 1 cup of hot water otherwise the sauce is too thin. I ended up mixing a bit of cornstarch in to thicken the sauce up.

Made this tonight and was blown away at how delicious it was. I don't like kale and would never pick a recipe with peanut butter and coconut milk. Believe me when I say that the flavors meld so well that neither is overpowering or even very noticeable.

I took the advice of others to use hot tap water with the coconut milk powder, which turned out perfect. And I used 1 cup instead of 1 1/2 cups of water. The sauce reduced and thickened quickly on high heat, which I lowered after a few minutes.

Don't be afraid of the spice. If you like spicy food then the whole package will work fine. If you like more mild, half the the spice will work fine.

I suggest seasoning the peanut sauce well with salt and leaving the rice unsalted. Keep tasting your peanut sauce until it's good. The rice and sauce together are amazing.

The kale was a nice complement. I suggest only two cloves of garlic or less if they are large cloves. ...See More

This meal was great. One hint--based on our (unfortunate) experience with the coconut milk powder last week, I heated the water in the microwave to about the temperature for coffee, and the powder dissolved and turned into milk as intended. I also cut off the "skin," which was mostly fat. The combination of flavors in the sauce had a wonderful taste. My wife and I are not into hot, spicy dishes, so we only used about half the spice provided. The good news is that we can use the other half another time. Our only complaint is that it took quite a bit longer than advertised to prepare and cook, but it was a small price to pay for a gourmet dish.

I think that there was too much water added to the coconut powder ~ I really had to cook down and reduce the sauce as it was so watery. Also, I did add the full spice package to the sauce, but it wasn't spicey hot - however the spices overwhemeled the peanut-coconut taste. I wish I had added less so I could pick up more of the peanut-coconut and less of the spice. I love hot things, but since this spice was not spicy-hot, it would have been better. But overall, I really loved this recipe.

I did cook the chicken with the skin on, but removed it before eating. I didn't think the skin had any benefit in this dish. The amount of water used for the coconut powder is too much. It took a long time to cook the sauce down and it never really thickened up. Although I really liked the flavors in the sauce, and would try making this again on my own, I did have to add more salt to compensate for the fact that the sauce was too thin and the seasoning got a little washed out.

Don't get me wrong, I love kale, but jeez seems like every box is either kale, collard greens or broccoli.

Easy shortcut, Open the chicken, dry it, throw it back in the zip top it came in toss in the spice mix, zip and shake.

I was given smoked paprika instead of west african spice blend. In the middle of cooking and I'm not real happy.

heat to a simmer. Cook, spooning the sauce over the chicken, 7 to 8 minutes, is this correct

I like the cards better now. I agree that canned coconut milk would be a lot easier.

Wow this meal is delicious! Thanks for the advice--1 cup of water for the coconut milk makes the sauce perfect!

ENOUGH with the sauteed kale already. I like kale (better in soups or as chips) but there are other green veggies that would add variety to these meals. I would have loved broccoli or spinach or green beans or sugar peas. I agree with taking the skin off sometimes but if you have a nice hot cast iron skillet you can cook the chicken skin side down and get it crispy and then roast it while prepping the rest.

I can't have salt in my diet. I can only have 2000 MG of sodium per day. What can I use instead of salt?

Loved the meal but hate the new format. Much harder to read/follow.

Also, for the last 18 months you've printed the make-up of most spice blends. Please continue. In fact, please reply with the make-up of this one.
