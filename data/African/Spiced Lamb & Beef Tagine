This was good, but it was REALLY good when I had a bite with the dates in it. I recieved only three dates for this recipe, but when I make it again I'm going to use ten! The sweetness of the date pulled all the other flavors together for me. And yes, it made a ton of food. I easily fed three people.

I just finished eating this. It was so delicious I had to jump online and shout my praises. I've been doing blue apron for about 8 months and I'm always a fan but this was one of my all time favorites. Yes, it did have large portions, which I love for leftovers, but I couldn't stop going back for seconds (and thirds!) 5 stars for this flavor combination and 2 thumbs up :) :) :)

I made this and thought it was lovely (even better the next day after the flavors had a chance to meld), but the amount of cous cous felt like way more than two servings! I divided this one into three plates for dinner and the next two lunches. It smelled and tasted great! Be warned, though, that the spice mix will definitely stain your white silicone and clear tupperware, so plan accordingly!

I loved this dish! The Ras El Hanout was not spicy for those who might be a bit concerned.

Also, I've learned that whenever BA sends couscous/or something like it, I always have to add another 1/4 cup of water to however much they say in the recipe. If I don't, it ends up a bit tough but the little bit of extra water means it comes out perfectly.

This dish was awesome. It ended up being 3 servings, which was a bonus. I would recommend chopping or ripping the mint leaves instead of leaving them whole but overall the taste was great and the whole house smelled of goodness.

This was just fabulous! A few extra dates would have been enjoyable, because those bites were really good, but equally good were the bites with the lemon-labneh. I'll definitely be making this combination again.

I made this last night and it was REALLY good, definitely a recipe I will make again. LOVE the Labneh! I agree that it needed more dates and I'm not a huge fan of mint so I added it as a light garnish, less for flavor. The only other thing is I wanted a bit more Ras El Hanout. It is a strong seasoning but I wanted more!

This was quite delicious; I don't know who does their measuring for servings though. They are so inconsistent. The Chicken Picatta we had yesterday was more like 1 persons portion, both in the noodles and the chicken. Today, there was enough couscous for 4 or 6 people! The Targine sauce portion was correct for 2 persons though; but nowhere near enough Labneh. At least I felt today's meal was more worth the $20 than yesterday's.

This was the first meal i didn't LOVE, mainly because I dislike lamb, but my husband really wanted to try this one. I thought the beef/lamb mix would help but it was still too lamb-y for my tastes. The sauce was AMAZING, and we will be making it again, maybe with venison or more veggies!

Why does every single ingredient have to come in a small individualy wrapped plastic bag? This is incredibly wasteful. Is it really not possible to send your recipes in a more environmentally-friendly way? For instance, couldn't you lump all the ingredients into one single container, or not use plastic bags in the first place? Is there nothing that's biodegradable that's available?

We had some left over spinach which found a home in this dish. We also small diced the zucchini. The dates made this a truly delish dish. The leftovers will be even tastier tomorrow. My beloved sez "Thank you!".

This really worked - even the couscous, which I've always had a problem cooking right. (I cooked it in my rice cooker, equal amounts couscous and water, a pat of butter and salt.) It was superb! I had one serving for dinner, plan on having leftover couscous for breakfast, and there will still be plenty for another meal or two,

We made it tonight. We both enjoyed it and I have some for lunch tomorrow. I salt and pepper along the way, but this could use a bit more salt than usual. The apartment hallway had the best aroma. In fact the, the aroma was great. There was more aroma then flavor, which seemed unusual. We will make this again.

Favorite meal so far. The flavor was spot on, the portions were generous, all of the elements of the dish complitemented each other so well. I did give the zuchinni to my roomate and used carrots in it's place because I can't stand squash.

BTW I did give extra sea salt and fresh ground pepper to the couscous after tasting and a small drizzle more olive oil. That made it perfect. Looks like I'm not the only one, now that I've read the comments.

This was fantastic! I loved the mix of flavors. I eliminated the zucchini and made white rice instead of couscous, but otherwise followed the directions, even discovering that I like chard. More dates would be good, but otherwise, it was perfect. The labneh was also new to me, and I loved the zing it added to the finished dish.

Agree that the bites with the dates were the best. I liked this dish, and am finally going to invest in a lemon zester (I know, big spender!) since so many of the recipes call for lemon zest and peeling/mincing lemon skin is among my least favorite tasks.

This was excellent. As soon as I opened the spice bag of ras el hanout, I was in absolute heaven. I sliced the mint chiffonade, and added it to the labneh, and it was a nice addition to the top of the dish!

When blue apron sends ground beef, does it have a fat/lean percentage label on it? I'm curious as to how fatty the meat is, I don't do well with anything much lower than 90% :(

Did anyone else have a gritty texture with this recipe? Both my boyfriend and I noticed every 4th to 5th bite when chewing, there was a weird gritty feeling in our teeth...like when you're eating at the beach and some sand gets on your food. Not sure if it was something in the spice packet. Anyway...just wondering if anyone else experienced this.

Otherwise, the flavor and cook on everything came out really good.

Can anyone tell me what the ratio of lamb to beef is for this recipe? I seem to have developed a taste sensitivity to ground lamb that makes the lamb taste "off".

After many, many perfect deliveries from Blue Apron, this one arrived missing an ingredient. Even more embarrassing the shipment contained a special insert card on the wonders and varieties of mint, and that was the missing ingredient - the mint.
$.99 and a trip to the supermarket later solved the problem.

I overcooked the zucchini/chard as I was attempting to let the sauce thicken. Lesson learned was to start with half the amount of water called for in the recipe and add more if necessary. The beef/lamb combo was extremely lean although I did not check for fat content, I feel it was no less than 90% lean. Good dish.

5 out of 5 stars. Loved the unexpected mix of ingredients. Thank you for the recycling instructions. I am happy to have everything divided individually for me and am glad not to have to feel guilty about it. Just one little suggestion - the instructions are printed so small that I have to use the internet version (thank you for putting it out there) and worry about having my Surface Pro in the greasy kitchen environment. I really enjoy this service. It cuts my shopping and meal planning time so much. Anyone who enjoys grocery shopping can't have a very exciting life.

This meal is up there in the top ranks along with the Green Shakshuka and Pork Tteokbokki! The labneh was a bit too sour for me so i'd probably only add one lemon slice of juice next time. And definitely more dates and more salt while cooking. My package of mint decided to walk off while I was prepping, so no garnish but I don't really like fresh mint so no big loss.

To think, I almost skipped this delivery --- so glad that I didn’t because this was incredible! Did add some mushrooms and a little extra tomato paste; chopped the mint and added it to the labneh. The couscous was perfect and the dates added that perfect bite of sweetness. Definitely engough food for three servings.
