I'm Moroccan and traditionally we steam couscous rather than boil or blanche it. Try this to avoid dryness: Steam for 10 min, remove and add oil, salt (and spice), then steam again for 10 min, remove, moisten it with water then steam for one final time. It should be very soft squishy :)

-Added nearly a cup of chicken broth to the couscous for flavor and moisture.
-To add flavor to the cod, at the very end I added a generous pat of butter to the pan, and squeezed the last two lemon wedges over it, rather than using them in the chard/couscous. WAY better.
- The quality of the fish itself was a little disappointing. I augmented it with cod from the local market which was so much better, and made the BA cod so obviously dry and fishy in comparison -- texturally, it tasted as though it was previously frozen.

I think as a general rule, Blue Apron sends 50% too much carbs. I think it's a good idea to pare down any rice, pasta, couscous or related items in half (at least).

This was a big meal. I just got out of the hospital, three day stay and was looking for some FOOD. There is nothing I can say bad about this dinner. I've never had the acone squash before. I will going forward. The spice was just right!
I've never had couscous cooked with chard before. That too was great. I will say the cod was the least part of the meal and it was good too.

Holy ER! I'm glad I read the suggestion about putting the squash in the microwave for a couple of minutes to soften it before attempting to slice it. Also, I peeled the squash as someone suggested. It was delicious as was the cod. The couscous was way too dry, even though I added more olive oil. Overall, really a nice meal.

First Blue Apron meal and loved it but only because of the Tips from Home Chefs. A THOUSAND THANK-YOUs to the busy but obviously kind cooks who explained: how to cook the fish without it sticking (and also how to coat both sides in a bag!), how to microwave the acorn squash (including the cutting the steam hole!) before trying to cut it, that we should add 1/4 cup of water to the cous-cous and drizzle with olive oil before serving and that the spice could be hot. The dish was a lot of work and would have been a disappointment without all of your help. So, hat's off to you, at home chefs who made the difference for us. We loved the dish and look forward to the next one because of you!

On our third week of BA meals and have been mostly very happy with the quality of ingredients and recipes. This was extremely disappointing. Although the cod was fresh, the ratio of couscous to the fresh ingredients was off. Very flavorless and dry. Squash was the highlight for sure. Will pass on Moroccan dishes in the future.

My husband I and both enjoyed this meal. Our cod was very fresh and tasty. I did coat both sides with the chickpea flour and it turned out great. When possible, I substitute coconut oil for olive oil. The acorn squash was a challenge to cut but it was a mission for my husband and he won! Good idea to microwave it to soften it a bit. The couscous was on the dry side and, we would have liked more chard. We loved the spice and used all of it!

You will have a lot easier time cutting the acorn squash if you give it a couple of minutes in the Microwave. (cut a hole for the steam to escape or you might have a messy explosion - haha!)

We have an electric range and use both nonstick and good quality stainless pans (All-Clad, I believe). I think the trick to the fish not sticking is two-fold: we pat it dry with paper towels as directed – that way you get a thin layer of coating. We shake the extra off before placing fish in the pan. (This also cuts down on the oil "spitting") The oil in the pan should be fairly hot so it moves quickly in the pan from side to side when you tilt the pan. We've learned that with a heavier, higher quality pan, we can cook at a lower heat because the pan retains the heat. We cook at a #4 setting (#1-10 on the dial). If your fish is sticking in stainless cookware it's usually because of: A) too much coating; B) not enough oil; or C) too high a heat (because your pan is too thin?). You can also try adding a tablespoon of water or white wine to the pan to "deglaze" the pan and loosen the fish's crust from the bottom of the pan before you turn it over.

This was a very interesting and flavorful dinner. We had no issues with the acorn squash skin or the couscous, but that is in part because I read through the comments first and sliced the squash a bit thinner than ½ in, and boiled a 1¼ cups of water for the couscous. I didn't peel the squash first and it was delicious. There were so many ingredients I've never used in my own cooking before - Ras El Hanout, acorn squash, chard. So, I really enjoyed learning how to prepare a meal using these ingredients that, before this, I'd only had in middle eastern restaurants and in the homes of our middle eastern family and friends. It tasted pretty authentic to me!

This was, at best, okay. I love cous-cous, but always as a base for something saucy like tagine. My lemon may also have been larger than some, but the lemon was REALLY agressive in the cous-cous and there was too much cous-cous vs. the amount of chart, raisins, etc. I would only use 2/3 cup of cous-cous in future (with corresponding drop in water amount). The cod was really good - I coated both sides with chickpea flour since I had plenty and just did about 3 minutes per side and it was crispy and delicious. Cutting the squash wasn't a problem - I just used a sharp butcher knife and 22 minutes was plenty. I love ras-el-hanout, but I don't think this dish was a very good feature. It's much better in slow-cooked dishes like tagine.

So something in the spice blend kind of ruined this one for us. We loved the cod, couscus, and squash. However there was some sort of menthol type mouth numbing ingredient that I have tasted before in blue apron recipes that we do not care for. The cinnamon was good, and I'm not sure what is in the spice blend that tastes like menthol. I kind of felt like it tasted like cinnamon gum. This could have been really great and I'd like to know what this dreaded ingredient is. We absolutely did not think there was too much couscus... a perfect amount. We did have a little left over but not that much.

I'm glad I read through the comments first. I cooked the couscous with 1.25 cups chicken broth and it turned out perfectly. I also left the remainder of the ras al hanout out of the couscous and mixed it in with the chickpea flour to coat the fish instead. I coated both sides since there was plenty to go around. Really, no complaints other than the fact that cod is not my favorite fish.... :)

Through blue apron, I have figured out I don't normally like North Aftrican dishes. Buuut, we had a few that I liked so I tried it. This is just a one out of five stars. I am not saying the recipe is bad, just polarizing and not to my taste. We threw out most of it and ate Trader Joe meatballs... Oh well, we will try a new one tomorrow.

This turned out really well for me. I burnt the squash (so hid it under to couscous). I think I might have sliced it too thin, so make sure you cut it thick enough and keep your eye on it. As others have said, make sure your oil is hot enough before adding the fish, and let the fish warm up a little as well. The couscous took a little care, and I thought I had screwed it up, but it actually all came together when I added the chard concoction. Would definitely make this again.

Most people have probably made this by now, but I'd like to throw in my 2 cents and echo some of the other comments. Definitely pierce and microwave the squash for a few minutes before attempting to cut it. I had to microwave it for a total of 4 minutes, but your mileage may vary. There was plenty of ras el hanout, so I divided it between the squash, couscous, and chickpea flour for the fish. I had so much breading for the fish, that I went ahead and breaded both sides. That worked out great! I also used chicken stock to cook the couscous and a pat of butter. I have enough couscous and squash leftover for lunch tomorrow, which is fine by me because it was tasty! I appreciate the warm, Fall flavors of this dish. Very good recipe with a few tweaks.

Divided household on this meal. A word about the acorn squash: this is one of the winter squashes, which by definition grow in colder weather and have hard skins to resist temperature changes. Butternut and patty-pan are two others often in the market now (although the butternut may be from Mexico). Get a big sturdy knife you can keep sharp, cut them raw, and scrape the flesh away from the skin after roasting. And pumpkin, too!
Our fish was nice quality. Appreciated suggestions about drying, etc. also appreciated that others found prep took a loooong time.

My husband and I really liked this one. I didn't find it very complicated. Used my largest, strongest knife with the squash on a flat end to go down the middle, then laying on its flat sides to slice. I'm definitely having trouble with most BA recipes that try to crust fish or meat, as I only have stainless pans. Think I'll try what others mentioned below--drying better and using cooking spray. The two teaspoons of oil in stainless just doesn't work.

This was a nice meal. The lemon/mint flavor was really nice in this dish. The couscous was dry even after the veg was added so I added some olive oil and that helped a lot. For the squash, you need a large sturdy knife to cut it, and push down on both ends of the knife - it took about 2 minutes to chop the squash. I didn't find the prep to be too invlolved with this one - it always helps to read the recipe ahead of time.

If I make it again: 1) I'd chop up the raisins a bit so they'd get distributed a better. 2) I didn't really notice the spice blend in the couscous over the lemon, so I wish they would have had us add that to the fish instead. 3) I'd skin the squash before cooking it - I ended up not eating the skin because ...ew.
