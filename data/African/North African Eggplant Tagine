I received Japanese eggplants, not Holland eggplants. I know they're fairly interchangeable, but in a dish that touts a specific variety of produce, it would be nice to have that to work with.

This is my favorite recipe after about a month of receiving Blue Apron. I LOVED the flavors and it was super simple. I will definitely be keeping this recipe and making it again. Good job Blue Apron on this one!!!

Even without the Holland eggplants, this is a great dish. I love the little bits of sweetness from the date mingled with the spices; there's probably enough here for three meals. Eggplant loves salt, so add salt early and often (and taste as you go!).

I think I too got Japanese eggplant.... Or it might be Chinese eggplant.

I only received one eggplant (Blue Apron made good with a refund). Anyway, I substituted a sweet potato, diced and steamed it for a couple of minutes, then added it with the other eggplant. A very satisfying dish!

This recipe was great! Is there a particular brand of ras el hanout which would be comprable and available online for purchase? I loved the blend of spices in the ras el hanout which was included with the recipe.

I really loved the flavor of this meal! I substituted Israeli couscous for what was provided because I like the texture better. Everything blended together so nicely and I've eaten this for dinner and two lunches and still have a little left over. YUM!

This is my FAVORITE blue apron recipe. I loved it so so much that I plan to cook it for dinner for a group of friends this weekend. Its simple, with very well-balanced flavors. I used another type of eggplant in my re-creation and it tasted just as good! :)

I have really enjoyed all of BA meals so far, but this one just missed the mark for me. I don't know, may have been more palatable with more finely diced eggplant. I just found the flavors to not be super cohesive and rather overpowering. My husband did really enjoy it and he's a chef, so maybe it is just my unrefined palette.
