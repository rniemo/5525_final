My husband is a bit leery about this week and he is Blue Apron's biggest fan. He thinks there's one too many exotic dishes. I will be swapping boneless chicken breasts for thighs after last week's Braised Chicken Thigh recipe. Anything I should watch out for?

Please stop sending chicken thighs. They are disgusting.

I love the chicken thighs- find they are incredibly juicy. Also love the exotic recipes, if I wanted to make plain food I would go shopping myself. The fun of Blue Apron is trying to cook things you have never made before. Thanks Blue Apron- keep it up!

How spicy is this mix? Is it possible to cut the heat at all? My husband and two children can't do very spicy.

I am also not a fan if chicken thighs. The last blue apron recipe with chicken thighs was rubbery. I will also substitute chicken breast.

Have never loved chicken...and when I did eat it, was usually chicken breasts. The chicken thighs you have been sending are fabulous!! Love the skin-on and braising method. Also makes great recipes to reheat.

I loved this meal! I thought the seasoning was great. My only issue was that it look a LOT longer to cook the chicken, maybe it was because I didn't have a large skillet but they were pretty much not-cooked when I followed the time. I covered them and cooked them another 10 min or so and they were just perfect! Great re-heated too!

I love the the spices and the dish turned out amazingly! I have to admit that I substituted chichen breast meat for the thighs and it worked great!!! My best friend likes thighs (dark meat) so nothing went to waste!! I will try this one on my own as well as some of the others!

A trick for any middle eastern/indian inspired dish like this that is a little spicy - if you have plain yogurt mix in up to 1/2 a cup at the end to cut the spicy-ness. I didn't have plain yogurt on hand but I used a tablespoon of cream cheese and about 1/4 cup of half and half. It gave the sauce a nice creamy texture and helped tone down the spice.

I also jazzed up the couscous with about 1/4 cup each sauteed chopped onion and chopped pineapple. The sweetness of the pineapple helps counter the spicy-ness as well.

I LOVED this recipe! And I loved the chicken thighs. I normally don't opt for them but they were perfect for this dish. I will absolutely make this again.

I've never liked Chicken thighs. Something about bones has grossed me out. That being said this was probably my favorite dish that I have cooked so far from Blue Apron. I can see why people might not like how spicy it was but for me it was perfect. Great recipe and something I will save for the future

Just cooked this, and the chicken was not done after the recommended time. I put it back in the pot with more water and covered it to finish cooking it. I looked up braising online and it says that you typically sear the meat then cover it with some liquid. The recipe doesn't state to cover the chicken at any point. Is that an error? Should the recipe be revised to include an instruction to cover the pan for proper braising?

Berber is wonderful sprinkled on split prawns before you grill them.
