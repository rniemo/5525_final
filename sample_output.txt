I cooked them in a covered pan with a cup or two of water (I added more if I though it might get too dry) and then to the fridge they went. When I was done cooking the steak I added the cooked collards to the pan to get the flavor of the fond and it was great! Second, I have a molcajete style mortar and pestle which I used for both the grains of paradise and the herb sauce. It ground the grains up nicely and it worked aces on the sauce--it basically turned the parsley into a paste that melted into the lime juice and oil.

I followed the recipe for boiling them and meanwhile made a little brown sugar glaze and then saut\xc3\xa9ed them in that.

Add more garlic if you like it or keep adding other spices. My husband added Sazon seasoning (achiote con cilantro).

We shake the extra off before placing fish in the pan. (This also cuts down on the oil "spitting") The oil in the pan should be fairly hot so it moves quickly in the pan from side to side when you tilt the pan. We\'ve learned that with a heavier, higher quality pan, we can cook at a lower heat because the pan retains the heat. We cook at a #4 setting (#1-10 on the dial). If your fish is sticking in stainless cookware it\'s usually because of: A) too much coating; B) not enough oil; or C) too high a heat (because your pan is too thin?). You can also try adding a tablespoon of water or white wine to the pan to "deglaze" the pan and loosen the fish\'s crust from the bottom of the pan before you turn it over.',

I didn't peel the squash first and it was delicious. There were so many ingredients I've never used in my own cooking before - Ras El Hanout, acorn squash, chard. So, I really enjoyed learning how to prepare a meal using these ingredients that, before this, I'd only had in middle eastern restaurants and in the homes of our middle eastern family and friends. It tasted pretty authentic to me!",

The cod was really good - I coated both sides with chickpea flour since I had plenty and just did about 3 minutes per side and it was crispy and delicious. Cutting the squash wasn't a problem - I just used a sharp butcher knife and 22 minutes was plenty. I love ras-el-hanout, but I don't think this dish was a very good feature. It's much better in slow-cooked dishes like tagine.",

I gave it 4-5 minutes before adding the tomatoes, scallions, butter, lemon juice, and shrimp, in that order. I made the shrimp a little less done in the initial step to guard against overcooking in Step 5, which worked out well.One more thing on the grits: You need to STIR them, a lot; and don't leave them unstirred for more than, say 30 seconds.

I enjoyed the variety of textures - zucchini, shrimp, corn, cherry tomato, scallions, cheese grits and how colorful the food looked. The zucchini, corn, tomato, and scallions were so fresh and beautiful - no bruises or brown spots. Tips: You will also need olive oil and a cheese grater for this recipe. It came with butter and paprika. I have the small glass prep bowls, and it made assembling the various ingredients easier. I lined them up in rows based on what group of ingredients I needed to add next. Although I added a big clove of garlic, next time, I may add two to add more flavor since I do not use as much salt. The 2 tsp of lemon zest gave a nice, subtle lemon flavor to the grits.',
